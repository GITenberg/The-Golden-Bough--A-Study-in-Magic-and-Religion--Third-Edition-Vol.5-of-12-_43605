        these three Oriental worships, akin to each other in character, I
        have paid more attention than formerly to the natural features of the
        countries in which they arose, because I am more than ever persuaded
        that religion, like all other institutions, has been profoundly
        influenced by physical environment, and cannot be understood without
        some appreciation of those aspects of external nature which stamp
        themselves indelibly on the thoughts, the habits, the whole life of a
        people. It is a matter of great regret to me that I have never
        visited the East, and so cannot describe from personal knowledge the
        native lands of Adonis, Attis, and Osiris. But I have sought to
        remedy the defect by comparing the descriptions of eye-witnesses, and
        painting from them what may be called composite pictures of some of
        the scenes on which I have been led to touch in the course of this

        giving me a clearer insight into the course of Hebrew history, has

        Edition.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In revising the
        book for this third edition I have made use of several important
        works which have appeared since the last edition was published. Among
        these I would name particularly the learned treatises of Count
        Baudissin on Adonis, of Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge on Osiris, and of my
        colleague Professor J. Garstang on the civilization of the Hittites,
        that still mysterious people, who begin to loom a little more
        distinctly from the mists of the past. Following the example of Dr.
        Wallis Budge, I have indicated certain analogies which may be traced
        between the worship of Osiris and the worship of the dead, especially
        of dead kings, among the modern tribes of Africa. The conclusion to
        which these analogies appear to point is that under the mythical pall
        of the glorified Osiris, the god who died and rose again from the
        dead, there once lay the body of a dead man. Whether that was so or
        not, I will not venture to say. The longer I occupy myself with
        questions of ancient mythology the more diffident I become of success
        in dealing with them, and I am apt to think that we who spend our
        years in searching for solutions of these insoluble problems are like
        Sisyphus perpetually rolling his stone up hill only to see it revolve
        again into the valley, or like the daughters of Danaus doomed for
        ever to pour water into broken jars that can hold no water. If we are
        taxed with wasting life in seeking to know what can never be known,
        and what, if it could be discovered, would not be worth knowing, what
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id=
        "Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can we plead in our defence? I
        fear, very little. Such pursuits can hardly be defended on the ground
        of pure reason. We can only say that something, we know not what,
        drives us to attack the great enemy Ignorance wherever we see him,
        and that if we fail, as we probably shall, in our attack on his
        entrenchments, it may be useless but it is not inglorious to fall in
        leading a Forlorn Hope.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spectacle of
          the great changes which annually pass over the face of the earth
          has powerfully impressed the minds of men in all ages, and stirred
          them to meditate on the causes of transformations so vast and
          wonderful. Their curiosity has not been purely disinterested; for
          even the savage cannot fail to perceive how intimately his own life
          is bound up with the life of nature, and how the same processes
          which freeze the stream and strip the earth of vegetation menace
          him with extinction. At a certain stage of development men seem to
          have imagined that the means of averting the threatened calamity
          were in their own hands, and that they could hasten or retard the
          flight of the seasons by magic art. Accordingly they performed
          ceremonies and recited spells to make the rain to fall, the sun to
          shine, animals to multiply, and the fruits of the earth to grow. In
          course of time the slow advance of knowledge, which has dispelled
          so many cherished illusions, convinced at least the more thoughtful
          portion of mankind that the alternations of summer and winter, of
          spring and autumn, were not merely the result of their own magical
          rites, but that some deeper cause, some mightier power, was at work
          behind the shifting scenes of nature. They now pictured to
          themselves the growth and decay of vegetation, the birth and death
          of living creatures, as effects of the waxing or waning strength of
          divine beings, of gods and goddesses, who were born and died, who
          married and begot children, on the pattern of human
          life.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg

              failing energies of the gods.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the old
          magical theory of the seasons was displaced, or rather
          supplemented, by a religious theory. For although men now
          attributed the annual cycle of change primarily to corresponding
          changes in their deities, they still thought that by performing
          certain magical rites they could aid the god, who was the principle
          of life, in his struggle with the opposing principle of death. They
          imagined that they could recruit his failing energies and even
          raise him from the dead. The ceremonies which they observed for
          this purpose were in substance a dramatic representation of the
          natural processes which they wished to facilitate; for it is a
          familiar tenet of magic that you can produce any desired effect by
          merely imitating it. And as they now explained the fluctuations of
          growth and decay, of reproduction and dissolution, by the marriage,
          the death, and the rebirth or revival of the gods, their religious
          or rather magical dramas turned in great measure on these themes.
          They set forth the fruitful union of the powers of fertility, the
          sad death of one at least of the divine partners, and his joyful
          resurrection. Thus a religious theory was blended with a magical
          practice. The combination is familiar in history. Indeed, few
          religions have ever succeeded in wholly extricating themselves from
          the old trammels of magic. The inconsistency of acting on two
          opposite principles, however it may vex the soul of the
          philosopher, rarely troubles the common man; indeed he is seldom
          even aware of it. His affair is to act, not to analyse the motives
          of his action. If mankind had always been logical and wise, history
          would not be a long chronicle of folly and crime.<a id="noteref_1"

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the changes
          which the seasons bring with them, the most striking within the
          temperate zone are those which affect vegetation. The influence of
          the seasons on animals, though great, is not nearly so manifest.
          Hence it is natural that in the magical dramas designed to dispel
          winter and bring back spring the emphasis should be laid on
          vegetation, and that trees and plants should in them more
          prominently than beasts and birds. Yet the two sides of life, the
          vegetable and the animal, were not dissociated in the minds of
          those who observed the ceremonies. Indeed they commonly believed
          that the tie between the animal and the vegetable world was even
          closer than it really is; hence they often combined the dramatic
          representation of reviving plants with a real or a dramatic union
          of the sexes for the purpose of furthering at the same time and by
          the same act the multiplication of fruits, of animals, and of men.
          To them the principle of life and fertility, whether animal or
          vegetable, was one and indivisible. To live and to cause to live,
          to eat food and to beget children, these were the primary wants of
          men in the past, and they will be the primary wants of men in the
          future so long as the world lasts. Other things may be added to
          enrich and beautify human life, but unless these wants are first
          satisfied, humanity itself must cease to exist. These two things,
          therefore, food and children, were what men chiefly sought to
          procure by the performance of magical rites for the regulation of
          the seasons.</p>

          Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, and Attis, the peoples of Egypt and Western

          of vegetable life, which they personified as a god who annually

          present inquiry. We begin with Tammuz or Adonis.<a id="noteref_2"

          Greeks through a misunderstanding converted the title of honour
          into a proper name. While Tammuz or his equivalent Adonis enjoyed a
          wide and lasting popularity among peoples of the Semitic stock,
          there are grounds for thinking that his worship originated with a
          race of other blood and other speech, the Sumerians, who in the
          dawn of history inhabited the flat alluvial plain at the head of
          the Persian Gulf and created the civilization which was afterwards
          called Babylonian. The origin and affinities of this people are
          unknown; in physical type and language they differed from all their
          neighbours, and their isolated position, wedged in between alien
          races, presents to the student of mankind problems of the same sort
          as the isolation of the Basques and Etruscans among the Aryan
          peoples of Europe. An ingenious, but unproved, hypothesis would
          represent them as immigrants driven from central Asia by that
          gradual desiccation which for ages seems to have been converting
          once fruitful lands into a waste and burying the seats of ancient
          civilization under a sea of shifting sand. Whatever their place of
          origin may have been, it is certain that in Southern Babylonia the
          Sumerians attained at a very early period to a considerable pitch
          of civilization; for they tilled the soil, reared cattle, built
          cities, dug canals, and even invented a system of writing, which
          their Semitic neighbours in time borrowed from them.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the religious
          literature of Babylonia Tammuz appears as the youthful spouse or
          lover of Ishtar, the great mother goddess, the embodiment of the
          reproductive energies of nature. The references to their connexion
          with each other in myth and ritual are both fragmentary and
          obscure, but we gather from them that every year Tammuz was
          believed to die, passing away from the cheerful earth to the gloomy
          subterranean world, and that every year his divine mistress
          journeyed in quest of him <span class="tei tei-q">“to the land from
          which there is no returning, to the house of darkness, where dust
          lies on door and bolt.”</span> During her absence the passion of
          love ceased to operate: men and beasts alike forgot to reproduce
          their kinds: all life was threatened with extinction. So
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name=
          "Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> intimately bound up
          with the goddess were the sexual functions of the whole animal
          kingdom that without her presence they could not be discharged. A
          messenger of the great god Ea was accordingly despatched to rescue
          the goddess on whom so much depended. The stern queen of the
          infernal regions, Allatu or Eresh-Kigal by name, reluctantly
          allowed Ishtar to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and to
          depart, in company probably with her lover Tammuz, that the two
          might return together to the upper world, and that with their
          return all nature might revive.</p>

          with oil, and clad in a red robe, while the fumes of incense rose
          into the air, as if to stir his dormant senses by their pungent

          Mirrored in the glass of Greek mythology, the oriental deity
          appears as a comely youth beloved by Aphrodite. In his infancy the
          goddess hid him in a chest, which she gave in charge to Persephone,
          queen of the nether world. But when Persephone opened the chest and
          beheld the beauty of the babe, she refused to give him back to
          Aphrodite, though the goddess of love went down herself to hell to
          ransom her dear one from the power of the grave. The dispute
          between the two goddesses of love and death was settled by Zeus,
          who decreed that Adonis should abide with Persephone in the under
          world for one part of the year, and with Aphrodite in the upper
          world for another part. At last the fair youth was killed in
          hunting by a wild boar, or by the jealous Ares, who turned himself
          into the likeness of a boar in order to compass the death of his
          rival. Bitterly did Aphrodite lament her loved and lost
          Adonis.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
          "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> The
          strife between the divine rivals for the possession of Adonis
          appears to be depicted on an Etruscan mirror. The two goddesses,
          identified by inscriptions, are stationed on either side of
          Jupiter, who occupies the seat of judgment and lifts an admonitory
          finger as he looks sternly towards Persephone. Overcome with grief
          the goddess of love buries her face in her mantle, while her
          pertinacious rival, grasping a branch in one hand, points with the
          other at a closed coffer, which probably contains the youthful
          Adonis.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

          myth, the contest between Aphrodite and Persephone for the
          possession of Adonis clearly reflects the struggle between Ishtar
          and Allatu in the land of the dead, while the decision of Zeus that
          Adonis is to spend one part of the year under ground and another
          part above ground is merely a Greek version of the annual
          disappearance and reappearance of Tammuz.</p>

          Adonis was localized and his rites celebrated with much solemnity
          at two places in Western Asia. One of these was Byblus on the coast
          of Syria, the other was Paphos in Cyprus. Both were great seats of
          the worship of Aphrodite, or rather of her Semitic counterpart,
          Astarte;<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=

          two cities Byblus was the more ancient; indeed it claimed to be the
          oldest city in Phoenicia, and to have been founded in the early
          ages of the world by the great god El, whom Greeks and Romans

          first of the kings of whom we have historical evidence was a
          certain Zekar-baal. He reigned about a century before Solomon; yet
          from that dim past his figure stands out strangely fresh and
          lifelike in the journal of an Egyptian merchant or official named
          Wen-Ammon, which has fortunately been preserved in a papyrus. This
          man spent some time with the king at Byblus, and received from him,
          in return for rich presents, a supply of timber felled in the
          forests of Lebanon.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
          Another king of Byblus, who bore the name of Sibitti-baal, paid
          tribute to Tiglath-pileser III., king of Assyria, about the year
          739 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Further, from an inscription of the fifth or fourth century before
          our era we learn that a king of Byblus, by name Yehaw-melech, son
          of Yehar-baal, and grandson of Adom-melech or Uri-melech, dedicated
          a pillared portico with a carved work of gold and a bronze altar to
          the goddess, whom he worshipped under the name of Baalath Gebal,
          that is, the female Baal of Byblus.<a id="noteref_28" name=

          equivalent to Melchizedek, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“king
          of righteousness,”</span> the title of that mysterious king of
          Salem and priest of God Most High, who seems to have been neither
          more nor less than one of these same Canaanitish kings of
          Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=

          if the old priestly kings of Jerusalem regularly played the part of
          Adonis, we need not wonder that in later times the women of
          Jerusalem used to weep for Tammuz, that is, for Adonis, at the

          doing so they may only have been continuing a custom which had been
          observed in the same place by the Canaanites long before the
          Hebrews invaded the land. Perhaps the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sacred men,”</span> as they were called, who lodged
          within the walls of the temple at Jerusalem down almost to the end
          of the Jewish kingdom,<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=

          have acted the part of the living Adonis to the living Astarte of
          the women. At all events we know that in the cells of <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> these strange clergy women wove

          sacred poles which stood beside the altar and which appear to have

          Certainly these <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred men”</span> must
          have discharged some function which was deemed religious in the
          temple at Jerusalem; and we can hardly doubt that the prohibition
          to bring the wages of prostitution into the house of God, which was
          published at the very same time that the men were expelled from the
          temple,<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=
          "#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> was
          directed against an existing practice. In Palestine as in other
          Semitic lands the hire of sacred prostitutes was probably dedicated
          to the deity as one of his regular dues: he took tribute of men and
          women as of flocks and herds, of fields and vineyards and
          oliveyards.</p>

          the part of a divinity, and particularly of Adonis, the divine lord

          well as a religious title. But whether identified with Adonis or
          not, the Hebrew kings certainly seem to have been regarded as in a
          sense divine, as representing and to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          divine or semi-divine rulers the Hebrew kings were apparently held
          answerable for famine and pestilence. When a dearth, caused perhaps
          by a failure of the winter rains, had visited the land for three
          years, King David inquired of the oracle, which discreetly laid the
          blame not on him but on his predecessor Saul. The dead king was
          indeed beyond the reach of punishment, but his sons were
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
          "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not. So David had
          seven of them sought out, and they were hanged before the Lord at
          the beginning of barley harvest in spring: and all the long summer
          the mother of two of the dead men sat under the gallows-tree,
          keeping off the jackals by night and the vultures by day, till with
          the autumn the blessed rain came at last to wet their dangling
          bodies and fertilize the barren earth once more. Then the bones of
          the dead were taken down from the gibbet and buried in the
          sepulchre of their fathers.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58"

          season when these princes were put to death, at the beginning of
          barley harvest, and the length of time they hung on the gallows,
          seem to show that their execution was not a mere punishment, but
          that it partook of the nature of a rain-charm. For it is a common
          belief that rain can be procured by magical ceremonies performed
          with dead men's bones,<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> and it
          would be natural to ascribe a special virtue in this respect to the
          bones of princes, who are often expected to give rain in their
          life. When the Israelites demanded of Samuel that he should give
          them a king, the indignant prophet, loth to be superseded by the
          upstart Saul, called on the Lord to send thunder and rain, and the
          Lord did so at once, though the season was early summer and the
          reapers were at work in the wheat-fields, a time when in common
          years no rain falls from the cloudless Syrian sky.<a id=

          pious historian who records the miracle seems to have regarded it
          as a mere token of the wrath of the deity, whose voice was heard in
          the roll of thunder; but we may surmise that in giving this
          impressive proof of his control of the weather Samuel meant to hint
          gently at the naughtiness of asking for a king to do for the
          fertility of the land what could be done quite as well and far more
          cheaply by a prophet.</p>

          bowed to the popular storm, acknowledged his guilt, and appeased
          the angry god by offering burnt sacrifices on the threshing-floor
          of Araunah, one of the old Jebusite inhabitants of Jerusalem. Then

          of the sanctity, nay the divinity of the Hebrew kings it may be
          objected that few traces of it survive in the historical books of
          the Bible. But the force of the objection is weakened by a
          consideration of the time and the circumstances in which these
          books assumed their final shape. The great prophets of the eighth
          and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg

          seventh centuries by the spiritual ideals and the ethical fervour
          of their teaching had wrought a religious and moral reform perhaps
          unparalleled in history. Under their influence an austere
          monotheism had replaced the old sensuous worship of the natural
          powers: a stern Puritanical spirit, an unbending rigour of mind,
          had succeeded to the old easy supple temper with its weak
          compliances, its wax-like impressionability, its proclivities to
          the sins of the flesh. And the moral lessons which the prophets
          inculcated were driven home by the political events of the time,
          above all by the ever-growing pressure of the great Assyrian empire
          on the petty states of Palestine. The long agony of the siege of
          Samaria<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=

          have been followed with trembling anxiety by the inhabitants of
          Judea, for the danger was at their door. They had only to lift up
          their eyes and look north to see the blue hills of Ephraim, at
          whose foot lay the beleaguered city. Its final fall and the
          destruction of the northern kingdom could not fail to fill every
          thoughtful mind in the sister realm with sad forebodings. It was as
          if the sky had lowered and thunder muttered over Jerusalem.
          Thenceforth to the close of the Jewish monarchy, about a century
          and a half later, the cloud never passed away, though once for a
          little it seemed to lift, when Sennacherib raised the siege of
          Jerusalem<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=

          the watchers on the walls beheld the last of the long line of
          spears and standards disappearing, the last squadron of the
          blue-coated Assyrian cavalry sweeping, in a cloud of dust, out of

          beings, whether kings or commoners, with the attributes of deity.

          kings in general and the kings of Byblus in particular often
          assumed the style of Baal or Adonis, it follows that they may have

          Certainly we hear of kings of Tyre and Sidon who were priests of
          Astarte.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=

          the agricultural Semites the Baal or god of a land was the author
          of all its fertility; he it was who produced the corn, the wine,
          the figs, the oil, and the flax, by means of his quickening waters,
          which in the arid parts of the Semitic world are oftener springs,
          streams, and underground flow than the rains of heaven.<a id=

          Further, <span class="tei tei-q">“the life-giving power of the god
          was not limited to vegetative nature, but to him also was ascribed
          the increase of animal life, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> multiplication of flocks and herds, and, not
          least, of the human inhabitants of the land. For the increase of
          animate nature is obviously conditioned, in the last resort, by the
          fertility of the soil, and primitive races, which have not learned
          to differentiate the various kinds of life with precision, think of
          animate as well as vegetable life as rooted in the earth and sprung
          from it. The earth is the great mother of all things in most
          mythological philosophies, and the comparison of the life of
          mankind, or of a stock of men, with the life of a tree, which is so
          common in Semitic as in other primitive poetry, is not in its
          origin a mere figure. Thus where the growth of vegetation is
          ascribed to a particular divine power, the same power receives the
          thanks and homage of his worshippers for the increase of cattle and
          of men. Firstlings as well as first-fruits were offered at the
          shrines of the Baalim, and one of the commonest classes of personal
          names given by parents to their sons or daughters designates the
          child as the gift of the god.”</span> In short, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Baal was conceived as the male principle of
          reproduction, the husband of the land which he
          fertilised.”</span><a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> So
          far, therefore, as the Semite personified the reproductive energies
          of nature as male and female, as a Baal and a Baalath, he appears
          to have identified the male power especially with water and the
          female especially with earth. On this view plants and trees,
          animals and men, are the offspring or children of the Baal and
          Baalath.</p>

          land and the increase of men and cattle by means of homoeopathic

          site of the temple has been discovered by modern travellers near
          the miserable village which still bears the name of Afka at the
          head of the wild, romantic, wooded gorge of the Adonis. The hamlet
          stands among groves of noble walnut-trees on the brink of the lyn.
          A little way off the river rushes from a cavern at the foot of a
          mighty amphitheatre of towering cliffs to plunge in a series of
          cascades into the awful depths of the glen. The deeper it descends,
          the ranker and denser grows the vegetation, which, sprouting from
          the crannies and fissures of the rocks, spreads a green veil over
          the roaring or murmuring stream in the tremendous chasm below.
          There is something delicious, almost intoxicating, in the freshness
          of these tumbling waters, in the sweetness and purity of the
          mountain air, in the vivid green of the vegetation. The temple, of
          which some massive hewn blocks and a fine column of Syenite granite
          still mark the site, occupied a terrace facing the source of the
          river and commanding a magnificent prospect. Across the foam and
          the roar of the waterfalls you look up to the cavern and away to
          the top of the sublime precipices above. So lofty is the cliff that
          the goats which creep along its ledges to browse on the bushes
          appear like ants to the spectator hundreds of feet below. Seaward
          the view is especially impressive when the sun floods the profound
          gorge with golden light, revealing all the fantastic buttresses and
          rounded towers of its mountain rampart, and falling softly on the
          varied green of the woods which clothe its depths.<a id=

          fairer scene could hardly be imagined for a story of tragic love
          and death. Yet, sequestered as the valley is and must always have
          been, it is not wholly deserted. A convent or a village may be
          observed here and there standing out against the sky on the top of
          some beetling crag, or clinging to the face of a nearly
          perpendicular cliff high above the foam and the din of the river;
          and at evening the lights that twinkle through the gloom betray the
          presence of human habitations on slopes which might seem
          inaccessible to man. In antiquity the whole of the lovely vale
          appears have been dedicated to Adonis, and to this day it is
          haunted by his memory; for the heights which shut it in are crested
          at various points by ruined monuments of his worship, some of them
          overhanging dreadful abysses, down which it turns the head dizzy to
          look and see the eagles wheeling about their nests far below. One
          such monument exists at Ghineh. The face of a great rock, above a
          roughly hewn recess, is here carved with figures of Adonis and
          Aphrodite. He is portrayed with spear in rest, awaiting the attack
          of a bear, while she is seated in an attitude of sorrow.<a id=

          the recess in the rock is perhaps her lover's tomb. Every year, in
          the belief of his worshippers, Adonis was wounded to death on the
          mountains, and every year the face of nature itself was dyed with
          his sacred blood. So year by year the Syrian damsels lamented his
          untimely fate,<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the great
          seat of the worship of Aphrodite and Adonis in Cyprus was Paphos on
          the south-western side of the island. Among the petty kingdoms into
          which Cyprus was divided from the earliest times until the end of
          the fourth century before our era Paphos must have ranked with the
          best. It is a land of hills and billowy ridges, diversified by
          fields and vineyards and intersected by rivers, which in the course
          of ages have carved for themselves beds of such tremendous depth
          that travelling in the interior is difficult and tedious. The lofty
          range of Mount Olympus (the modern Troodos), capped with snow the
          greater part of the year, screens Paphos from the northerly and
          easterly winds and cuts it off from the rest of the island. On the
          slopes of the range the last pine-woods of Cyprus linger,
          sheltering here and there monasteries <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          old city of Paphos occupied the summit of a hill about a mile from
          the sea; the newer city sprang up at the harbour some ten miles
          off.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=

          sanctuary of Aphrodite at Old Paphos (the modern Kuklia) was one of
          the most celebrated shrines in the ancient world. From the earliest
          to the latest times it would seem to have preserved its essential
          features unchanged. For the sanctuary is represented on coins of
          the Imperial age,<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
          "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          these representations agree closely with little golden models of a

          on the coins and in the models we see a façade surmounted by a pair
          of doves and divided into three compartments or chapels, of which
          the central one is crowned by a lofty superstructure. In the golden
          models each chapel contains a pillar standing in a pair of horns:
          the central superstructure is crowned by two pairs of horns, one
          within the other; and the two side chapels are in like manner
          crowned each with a pair of horns and a single dove perched on the
          outer horn of each pair. On the coins each of the side chapels
          contains a pillar or candelabra-like object: the central chapel
          contains a cone and is flanked by two high columns, each
          terminating in a pair of ball-topped pinnacles, with a star and
          crescent appearing between the tops of the columns. The doves are
          doubtless the sacred doves of Aphrodite or Astarte,<a id=

          remind us of the similar religious emblems which have been found in

          antiquaries are right in regarding the golden models as copies of
          the Paphian shrine, that shrine must have suffered little outward
          change for more than a thousand years; for the royal graves at
          Mycenae, in which the models were found, can hardly be of later
          date than the twelfth century before our era.</p>

          is possible that a native goddess of fertility was worshipped on
          the spot before the arrival of the Phoenicians, and that the
          newcomers identified her with their own Baalath or Astarte, whom
          she may have closely resembled. If two deities were thus fused in
          one, we may suppose that they were both varieties of that great
          goddess of motherhood and fertility whose worship appears to have
          been spread all over Western Asia from a very early time. The

          Similar customs prevailed in many parts of Western Asia. Whatever
          its motive, the practice was clearly regarded, not as an orgy of
          lust, but as a solemn religious duty performed in the service of
          that great Mother Goddess of Western Asia whose name varied, while
          her type remained constant, from place to place. Thus at Babylon
          every woman, whether rich or poor, had once in her life to submit
          to the embraces of a stranger at the temple of Mylitta, that is, of
          Ishtar or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg

          Astarte, and to dedicate to the goddess the wages earned by this
          sanctified harlotry. The sacred precinct was crowded with women
          waiting to observe the custom. Some of them had to wait there for

          its ruined temples, the custom of the country required that every
          maiden should prostitute herself to a stranger at the temple of
          Astarte, and matrons as well as maids testified their devotion to
          the goddess in the same manner. The emperor Constantine abolished

          as the second century of our era. It records of a certain woman,
          Aurelia Aemilia by name, not only that she herself served the god
          in the capacity of a harlot at his express command, but that her
          mother and other female ancestors had done the same before her; and
          the publicity of the record, engraved on a marble column which

          whole of the evidence on this subject, some of which has still to
          be laid before the reader, we may conclude that a great Mother
          Goddess, the personification of all the reproductive energies of
          nature, was worshipped under different names but with a substantial
          similarity of myth and ritual by many peoples of Western Asia; that
          associated with her was a lover, or rather series of lovers, divine
          yet mortal, with whom she mated year by year, their commerce being
          deemed essential to the propagation of animals and plants, each in
          their several kind;<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href=

          further, that the fabulous union of the divine pair was simulated
          and, as it were, multiplied on earth by the real, though temporary,
          union of the human sexes at the sanctuary of the goddess for the
          sake of thereby ensuring the fruitfulness of the ground and the
          increase of man and beast.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123"

          conception of such a Mother Goddess dates, as seems probable, from
          a time when the institution of marriage was either unknown or at
          most barely tolerated as an immoral infringement of old communal
          rights, we can understand both why the goddess herself was
          regularly supposed to be at once unmarried and unchaste, and why
          her worshippers were obliged to imitate her more or less completely
          in these respects. For had she been a divine wife united to a
          divine husband, the natural counterpart of their union would have
          been the lawful marriage of men and women, and there would have
          been no need to resort to a system of prostitution or promiscuity
          in order to effect those purposes which, on the principles of
          homoeopathic magic, might in that case have been as well or better
          attained by the legitimate intercourse of the sexes in matrimony.
          Formerly, perhaps, every woman was obliged to submit at least once
          in her life to the exercise of those marital rights which at a
          still earlier period had theoretically belonged in permanence to
          all the males of the tribe. But in course of time, as the
          institution of individual marriage grew in favour, and the old
          communism fell more and more into discredit, the revival of the
          ancient practice even for a single occasion in a woman's life
          became ever more repugnant to the moral sense of the people, and
          accordingly they resorted to various expedients for evading in
          practice the obligation which they still acknowledged in theory.
          One of these evasions was to let the woman offer her hair instead
          of her person; another apparently was to substitute an obscene
          symbol for the obscene act.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124"
          href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> But
          while the majority of women thus contrived to observe the forms of
          religion without sacrificing their virtue, it was still thought
          necessary to the general welfare that a certain number of them
          should discharge the old obligation in the old way. These became
          prostitutes either for life or for a term of years at one of the
          temples: dedicated to the service of religion, they were invested
          with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name=

          their vocation, far from being deemed infamous, was probably long
          regarded by the laity as an exercise of more than common virtue,
          and rewarded with a tribute of mixed wonder, reverence, and pity,
          not unlike that which in some parts of the world is still paid to
          women who seek to honour their Creator in a different way by
          renouncing the natural functions of their sex and the tenderest
          relations of humanity. It is thus that the folly of mankind finds
          vent in opposite extremes alike harmful and deplorable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legendary
          history of the royal and priestly family of the Cinyrads is
          instructive. We are told that a Syrian man, by name Sandacus,
          migrated to Cilicia, married Pharnace, daughter of Megassares, king
          of Hyria, and founded the city of Celenderis. His wife bore him a
          son, Cinyras, who in time crossed the sea with a company of people
          to Cyprus, wedded Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of the
          island, and founded Paphos.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128"

          seem to contain reminiscences of kingdoms in Cilicia and Cyprus
          which passed in the female line, and were held by men, sometimes
          foreigners, who married the hereditary princesses. There are some
          indications that Cinyras was not in fact the founder of the temple
          at Paphos. An older tradition ascribed the foundation to a certain
          Aerias, whom some regarded as a king, and others as the goddess
          herself.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href=

          Moreover, Cinyras or his descendants at Paphos had to reckon with
          rivals. These were the Tamirads, a family of diviners who traced
          their descent from Tamiras, a Cilician augur. At first it was
          arranged that both families should preside at the ceremonies, but
          afterwards the Tamirads gave way to the Cinyrads.<a id=

          his descendants, the Cinyrads, he appears to have bequeathed his
          wealth and his dignities; at all events, they reigned as kings of
          Paphos and served the goddess as priests. Their dead bodies, with
          that of Cinyras himself, were buried in the sanctuary.<a id=

          by the fourth century before our era the family had declined and
          become nearly extinct. When Alexander the Great expelled a king of
          Paphos for injustice and wickedness, his envoys made search for a
          member of the ancient house to set on the throne of his fathers. At

          them living in obscurity and earning his bread as a market
          gardener. He was in the very act of watering his beds when the

          stories which were told of Cinyras, the ancestor of these priestly
          kings and the father of Adonis, there are some that deserve our
          attention. In the first place, he is said to have begotten his son
          Adonis in incestuous intercourse with his daughter Myrrha at a
          festival of the corn-goddess, at which women robed in white were
          wont to offer corn-wreaths as first-fruits of the harvest and to
          observe strict chastity for nine days.<a id="noteref_137" name=

          seems unlikely that such reports are without foundation, and
          perhaps equally improbable that they refer to mere fortuitous
          outbursts of unnatural lust. We may suspect that they are based on
          a practice actually observed for a definite reason in certain
          special circumstances. Now in countries where the royal blood was
          traced through women only, and where consequently the king held
          office merely in virtue of his marriage with an hereditary
          princess, who was the real sovereign, it appears to have often
          happened that a prince married his own sister, the princess royal,
          in order to obtain with her hand the crown which otherwise would
          have gone to another man, perhaps to a stranger.<a id="noteref_139"

          not the same rule of descent have furnished a motive for incest
          with a daughter? For it seems a natural corollary from such a rule
          that the king was bound to vacate the throne on the death of his
          wife, the queen, since he occupied it only by virtue of his
          marriage with her. When that marriage terminated, his right to the
          throne terminated with it and passed at once to his daughter's
          husband. Hence if the king desired to reign after his wife's death,
          the only way in which he could legitimately continue to do so was
          by marrying his daughter, and thus prolonging through her the title
          which had formerly been his through her mother.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          connexion it is worth while to remember that at Rome the Flamen

          rule would be intelligible if the Flaminica had originally been the
          more important functionary of the two, and if the Flamen held
          office only by virtue of his marriage with her.<a id="noteref_141"

          Elsewhere I have shown reason to suppose that he and his wife
          represented an old line of priestly kings and queens, who played
          the parts of Jupiter and Juno, or perhaps rather Dianus and Diana,
          respectively.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href=
          "#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> If
          the supposition is correct, the custom which obliged him to resign
          his priesthood on the death of his wife seems to prove that of the
          two deities whom they personated, the goddess, whether named Juno
          or Diana, was indeed the better half. But at Rome the goddess Juno
          always played an insignificant part; whereas at Nemi her old
          double, Diana, was all-powerful, casting her mate, Dianus or
          Virbius, into deep shadow. Thus a rule which points to the
          superiority of the Flaminica over the Flamen, appears to indicate
          that the divine originals of the two were Dianus and Diana rather
          than Jupiter and Juno; and further, that if Jupiter and Juno at
          Rome stood for the principle of father-kin, or the predominance of
          the husband over the wife, Dianus and Diana at Nemi stood for the
          older principle of mother-kin, or the predominance of the wife in
          matters of inheritance over the husband. If, then, I am right in
          holding that the kingship at Rome was originally a plebeian
          institution and descended through women,<a id="noteref_143" name=

          must conclude that the people who founded the sanctuary of Diana at
          Nemi were of the same plebeian stock as the Roman kings, that they
          traced descent in the female line, and that they worshipped a great
          Mother Goddess, not a great Father God. That goddess was Diana; her
          maternal functions are abundantly proved by the votive offerings
          found at her ancient shrine among the wooded hills.<a id=

          survival of the time when, under the matriarchate, the priestess
          was the agent for the performance of all religious
          ceremonies.”</span> It does not appear that the priest need be the
          husband of the priestess; but in the Khyrim State, where each
          division has its own goddess to whom sacrifices are offered, the
          priestess is the mother, sister, niece, or other maternal relation
          of the priest. It is her duty to prepare all the sacrificial
          articles, and without her assistance the sacrifice cannot take
          place.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> Here,
          then, as among the ancient Romans on my hypothesis, we have the
          superiority of the priestess over the priest based on a
          corresponding superiority of the goddess or divine ancestress over
          the god or divine ancestor; and here, as at Rome, a priest would
          clearly have to vacate office if he had no woman of the proper
          relationship to assist him in the performance of his sacred
          duties.</p>

          ceremony of the Sacred Marriage has been described more fully by a
          Jesuit missionary, who was intimately acquainted with the people
          and their native religion. The rite is celebrated in the month of
          May, when the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sal</span></span> tree is in bloom, and the
          festival takes its native name (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">khaddi</span></span>) from the flower of the
          tree. It is the greatest festival of the year. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The object of this feast is to celebrate the mystical
          marriage of the Sun-god (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dharti-mai</span></span>), to induce them to
          be fruitful and give good crops.”</span> At the same time all the
          minor deities or demons of the village are propitiated, in order
          that they may not hinder the beneficent activity of the Sun God and
          the Earth Goddess. On the eve of the appointed day no man may
          plough his fields, and the priest, accompanied by some of the
          villagers, repairs to the sacred grove, where he beats a drum and
          invites all the invisible guests to the great feast that will await
          them on the morrow. Next morning very early, before cock-crow, an
          acolyte steals out as quietly as possible to the sacred spring to
          fetch water in a new earthen pot. This holy water is full of all
          kinds of blessings for the crops. The priest has prepared a place
          for it in the middle of his house surrounded by cotton threads of
          diverse colours. So sacred is the water that it would be defiled
          and lose all its virtue, were any profane eye to fall on it before
          it entered the priest's house. During the morning the acolyte and
          the priest's deputy go round from house to house collecting victims
          for the sacrifice. In the afternoon the people all gather at the
          sacred grove, and the priest proceeds to consummate the sacrifice.
          The first victims to be immolated are a white cock for the Sun God
          and a black hen for the Earth Goddess; and as the feast is the
          marriage of these great deities the marriage service is performed
          over the two fowls before they are hurried into eternity. Amongst
          other things both birds are marked with vermilion just as a bride
          and bridegroom are marked at a human marriage; and the earth is
          also smeared with vermilion, as if it were a real bride, on the
          spot where <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the sacrifice is offered. Sacrifices of fowls or goats to the minor
          deities or demons follow. The bodies of the victims are collected
          by the village boys, who cook them on the spot; all the heads go to
          the sacrificers. The gods take what they can get and are more or
          less thankful. Meantime the acolyte has collected flowers of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sal</span></span> tree and set them round the
          place of sacrifice, and he has also fetched the holy water from the
          priest's house. A procession is now formed and the priest is
          carried in triumph to his own abode. There his wife has been
          watching for him, and on his arrival the two go through the
          marriage ceremony, applying vermilion to each other in the usual
          way <span class="tei tei-q">“to symbolise the mystical marriage of
          the Sun-god with the Earth-goddess.”</span> Meantime all the women
          of the village are standing on the thresholds of their houses each
          with a winnowing-fan in her hand. In the fan are two cups, one
          empty to receive the holy water, and the other full of rice-beer
          for the consumption of the holy man. As he arrives at each house,
          he distributes flowers and holy water to the happy women, and
          enriches them with a shower of blessings, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May your rooms and granary be filled with rice, that
          the priest's name may be great.”</span> The holy water which he
          leaves at each house is sprinkled on the seeds that have been kept
          to sow next year's crop. Having thus imparted his benediction to
          the household the priest swigs the beer; and as he repeats his
          benediction and his potation at every house he is naturally
          dead-drunk by the time he gets to the end of the village.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“By that time every one has taken copious
          libations of rice-beer, and all the devils of the village seem to
          be let loose, and there follows a scene of debauchery baffling
          description—all these to induce the Sun and the Earth to be
          fruitful.”</span><a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=

          Cinyras was in a sense a duplicate of his handsome son Adonis, to
          whom the inflammable goddess also lost her heart. Further, these
          stories of the love of Aphrodite for two members of the royal house
          of Paphos can hardly be dissociated from the corresponding legend
          told of Pygmalion, the Phoenician king of Cyprus, who is said to
          have fallen in love with an image of Aphrodite and taken it to his
          bed.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href=

          we consider that Pygmalion was the father-in-law of Cinyras, that
          the son of Cinyras was Adonis, and that all three, in successive
          generations, are said to have been concerned in a love-intrigue
          with Aphrodite, we can hardly help concluding that the early
          Phoenician kings of Paphos, or their sons, regularly claimed to be
          not merely the priests of the goddess<a id="noteref_154" name=

          also her lovers, in other words, that in their official capacity
          they personated Adonis. At all events Adonis is said to have
          reigned in Cyprus,<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href=
          "#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> and
          it appears to be certain that the title of Adonis was regularly
          borne by the sons of all the Phoenician kings of the island.<a id=
          "noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> It is
          true that the title strictly signified no more than <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord”</span>; yet the legends which connect these
          Cyprian princes with the goddess of love make it probable that they
          claimed the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
          050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          divine nature as well as the human dignity of Adonis. The story of
          Pygmalion points to a ceremony of a sacred marriage in which the
          king wedded the image of Aphrodite, or rather of Astarte. If that
          was so, the tale was in a sense true, not of a single man only, but
          of a whole series of men, and it would be all the more likely to be
          told of Pygmalion, if that was a common name of Semitic kings in
          general, and of Cyprian kings in particular. Pygmalion, at all
          events, is known as the name of the famous king of Tyre from whom
          his sister Dido fled;<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href=
          "#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> and a
          king of Citium and Idalium in Cyprus, who reigned in the time of
          Alexander the Great, was also called Pygmalion, or rather
          Pumiyathon, the Phoenician name which the Greeks corrupted into
          Pygmalion.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>
          Further, it deserves to be noted that the names Pygmalion and
          Astarte occur together in a Punic inscription on a gold medallion
          which was found in a grave at Carthage; the characters of the
          inscription are of the earliest type.<a id="noteref_159" name=

          the custom of religious prostitution at Paphos is said to have been

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> we
          may surmise that the kings of Paphos played the part of the divine
          bridegroom in a less innocent rite than the form of marriage with a
          statue; in fact, that at certain festivals each of them had to mate
          with one or more of the sacred harlots of the temple, who played
          Astarte to his Adonis. If that was so, there is more truth than has
          commonly been supposed in the reproach cast by the Christian
          fathers that the Aphrodite worshipped <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by Cinyras was a common whore.<a id=

          fruit of their union would rank as sons and daughters of the deity,
          and would in time become the parents of gods and goddesses, like
          their fathers and mothers before them. In this manner Paphos, and
          perhaps all sanctuaries of the great Asiatic goddess where sacred
          prostitution was practised, might be well stocked with human
          deities, the offspring of the divine king by his wives, concubines,
          and temple harlots. Any one of these might probably succeed his
          father on the throne<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href=
          "#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          sacrificed in his stead whenever stress of war or other grave
          junctures called, as they sometimes did,<a id="noteref_163" name=

          the death of a royal victim. Such a tax, levied occasionally on the
          king's numerous progeny for the good of the country, would neither
          extinguish the divine stock nor break the father's heart, who
          divided his paternal affection among so many. At all events, if, as
          there seems reason to believe, Semitic kings were often regarded at
          the same time as hereditary deities, it is easy to understand the
          frequency of Semitic personal names which imply that the bearers of
          them were the sons or daughters, the brothers or sisters, the
          fathers or mothers of a god, and we need not resort to the shifts
          employed by some scholars to evade the plain sense of the
          words.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

          the instrument on which David played before Saul.<a id=

          shall probably not err in assuming that at Paphos as at Jerusalem
          the music of the lyre or harp was not a mere pastime designed to
          while away an idle hour, but formed part of the service of
          religion, the moving influence of its melodies being perhaps set
          down, like the effect of wine, to the direct inspiration of a
          deity. Certainly at Jerusalem the regular clergy of the temple
          prophesied to the music of harps, of psalteries, and of
          cymbals;<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=
          "#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> and
          it appears that the irregular clergy also, as we may call the
          prophets, depended on some such stimulus for inducing the ecstatic
          state which they took for immediate converse with the
          divinity.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> Thus
          we read of a band of prophets coming down from a high place with a
          psaltery, a timbrel, a pipe, and a harp before them, and
          prophesying as they went.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171"

          Again, when the united forces of Judah and Ephraim were traversing
          the wilderness of Moab in pursuit of the enemy, they could find no
          water for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
          053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          three days, and were like to die of thirst, they and the beasts of
          burden. In this emergency the prophet Elisha, who was with the
          army, called for a minstrel and bade him play. Under the influence
          of the music he ordered the soldiers to dig trenches in the sandy
          bed of the waterless waddy through which lay the line of march.
          They did so, and next morning the trenches were full of the water
          that had drained down into them underground from the desolate,
          forbidding mountains on either hand. The prophet's success in
          striking water in the wilderness resembles the reported success of
          modern dowsers, though his mode of procedure was different.
          Incidentally he rendered another service to his countrymen. For the
          skulking Moabites from their lairs among the rocks saw the red sun
          of the desert reflected in the water, and taking it for the blood,
          or perhaps rather for an omen of the blood, of their enemies, they
          plucked up heart to attack the camp and were defeated with great
          slaughter.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href=

          religious writer, himself deeply sensitive to the witchery of
          music, has said that musical notes, with all their power to fire
          the blood and melt the heart, cannot be mere empty sounds and
          nothing more; no, they have escaped from some higher sphere, they
          are outpourings of eternal harmony, the voice of angels, the

          054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of religion is a subject which would repay a sympathetic study. For
          we cannot doubt that this, the most intimate and affecting of all
          the arts, has done much to create as well as to express the
          religious emotions, thus modifying more or less deeply the fabric
          of belief to which at first sight it seems only to minister. The
          musician has done his part as well as the prophet and the thinker
          in the making of religion. Every faith has its appropriate music,
          and the difference between the creeds might almost be expressed in
          musical notation. The interval, for example, which divides the wild
          revels of Cybele from the stately ritual of the Catholic Church is
          measured by the gulf which severs the dissonant clash of cymbals
          and tambourines from the grave harmonies of Palestrina and Handel.
          A different spirit breathes in the difference of the music.<a id=

          be based on a belief in their common devotion to the lyre. But what
          function, we may ask, did string music perform in the Greek and the
          Semitic ritual? Did it serve to rouse the human mouthpiece of the
          god to prophetic ecstasy? or did it merely ban goblins and demons
          from the holy places and the holy service, drawing as it were
          around the worshippers a magic circle within which no evil thing
          might intrude? In short, did it aim at summoning good or banishing
          evil spirits? was its object inspiration or exorcism? The examples
          drawn from the lives or legends of Elisha and David prove that with
          the Hebrews the music of the lyre might be used for either purpose;
          for while Elisha employed it to tune himself to the prophetic
          pitch, David resorted to it for the sake of exorcising the foul
          fiend from Saul. With the Greeks, on the other hand, in historical
          times, it does not appear that string music served as a means of
          inducing the condition of trance or ecstasy in the human
          mouthpieces of Apollo and the other oracular gods; on the contrary,
          its sobering and composing influence, as contrasted with the
          exciting influence of flute music, is the aspect which chiefly
          impressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg

          religious or, at all events, the superstitious man might naturally
          ascribe the mental composure wrought by grave, sweet music to a
          riddance of evil spirits, in short to exorcism; and in harmony with
          this view, Pindar, speaking of the lyre, says that all things
          hateful to Zeus in earth and sea tremble at the sound of
          music.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href=

          the association of the lyre with the legendary prophet Orpheus as
          well as with the oracular god Apollo seems to hint that in early
          days its strains may have been employed by the Greeks, as they
          certainly were by the Hebrews, to bring on that state of mental
          exaltation in which the thick-coming fancies of the visionary are
          regarded as divine communications.<a id="noteref_179" name=

          the minds of his worshippers.</p>

            places where the supposed custom is really practised.<a id=

            in Western Asia it was just the contrary. It was the woman who
            was paid, not the man; indeed, so well was she paid that in Lydia
            and Cyprus the girls earned dowries for themselves in this
            fashion.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href=

            This clearly shows that it was the woman, and not the man, who
            was believed to render the service. Or are we to suppose that the

            considerations seem to prove conclusively that whatever the

            is assumed by the hypothesis under discussion. At the period when
            we have to do with them the customs were to all appearance purely
            religious in character, and a religious motive must accordingly
            be found for them. Such a motive is supplied by the theory I have
            adopted, which, so far as I can judge, adequately explains all
            the known facts.</p>

            derive the sacred prostitution of Western Asia has not always
            been purely secular in character. For, in the first place, the
            agent employed is sometimes reported to be a priest;<a id=

            and, in the second place, the sacrifice of virginity has in some
            places, for example at Rome and in parts of India, been made
            directly to the image of a male deity.<a id="noteref_196" name=

            meaning of these practices is very obscure, and in the present
            state of our ignorance on the subject it is unsafe to build
            conclusions on them. It is possible that what seems to be a
            purely secular precaution may be only a degenerate form of a
            religious rite; and on the other hand it is possible that the
            religious rite may go back to a purely physical preparation for
            marriage, such as is still observed among the aborigines of
            Australia.<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href=

            historical origin could be established, it would not explain the
            motives from which the customs described in this volume were
            practised by the people of Western Asia in historical times. The
            true parallel to these customs is the sacred prostitution which
            is carried on to this day by dedicated women in India and Africa.
            An examination of these modern practices may throw light on the
            ancient customs.</p>

            common parlance they are spoken of simply as harlots. Every Tamil
            temple of note in Southern India has its troop of these sacred
            women. Their official duties are to dance twice a day, morning
            and evening, in the temple, to fan the idol with Tibetan
            ox-tails, to dance and sing before it when it is borne in
            procession, and to carry the holy light called <span class=

            temple of the Chola king Rajaraja at Tanjore had attached to it

            about it and were allowed land free of taxes out of its
            endowment. From infancy they are trained to dance and sing. In
            order to obtain a safe delivery expectant mothers will often vow
            to dedicate their child, if she should prove to be a girl, to the
            service of God. Among the weavers of Tiru-kalli-kundram, a little
            town in the Madras Presidency, the eldest daughter of every
            family is devoted to the temple. Girls thus made over to the
            deity are formally married, sometimes to the idol, sometimes to a
            sword, before they enter on their duties; from which it appears
            that they are often, if not regularly, regarded as the wives of
            the god.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href=

            Kaikolans, a large caste of Tamil weavers who are spread all over
            Southern India, at least one girl in every family should be
            dedicated to the temple service. The ritual, as it is observed at
            the initiation of one of these girls in Coimbatore, includes
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a form of nuptial ceremony. The
            relations are invited for an auspicious day, and the maternal
            uncle, or his representative, ties a gold band on the girl's
            forehead, and, carrying her, places her on a plank before the
            assembled guests. A Brahman priest recites the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">mantrams</span></span>, and prepares the
            sacred fire (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">hōmam</span></span>). The uncle is presented
            with new cloths by the girl's mother. For the actual nuptials a
            rich Brahman, if possible, and, if not, a Brahman of more lowly
            status is invited. A Brahman is called in, as he is next in
            importance to, and the representative of the idol. It is said
            that, when the man who is to receive her first favours, joins the
            girl, a sword must be placed, at least for a few minutes, by her
            side.”</span> When one of these dancing-girls dies, her body is
            covered with a new cloth which has been taken for the purpose
            from the idol, and flowers are supplied from the temple to which
            she belonged. No worship is performed in the temple until the
            last rites have been performed over her body, because the idol,
            being deemed her husband, is held to be in that state of
            ceremonial pollution common to human mourners which debars him
            from the offices of religion.<a id="noteref_199" name=

            Mahratta such a female devotee is called Murli. Common folk
            believe that from time to time the shadow of the god falls on her

            person. At such times the possessed woman rocks herself to and
            fro, and the people occasionally consult her as a soothsayer,
            laying money at her feet and accepting as an oracle the words of
            wisdom or folly that drop from her lips.<a id="noteref_200" name=

            is the profession of a temple prostitute adopted only by girls.
            In Tulava, a district of Southern India, any woman of the four
            highest castes who wearies of her husband or, as a widow and
            therefore incapable of marriage, grows tired of celibacy, may go
            to a temple and eat of the rice offered to the idol. Thereupon,
            if she is a Brahman, she has the right to live either in the
            temple or outside of its precincts, as she pleases. If she
            decides to live in it, she gets a daily allowance of rice, and
            must sweep the temple, fan the idol, and confine her amours to
            the Brahmans. The male children of these women form a special
            class called Moylar, but are fond of assuming the title of
            Stanikas. As many of them as can find employment hang about the
            temple, sweeping the areas, sprinkling them with cow-dung,
            carrying torches before the gods, and doing other odd jobs. Some
            of them, debarred from these holy offices, are reduced to the
            painful necessity of earning their bread by honest work. The
            daughters are either brought up to live like their mothers or are
            given in marriage to the Stanikas. Brahman women who do not
            choose to live in the temples, and all the women of the three
            lower castes, cohabit with any man of pure descent, but they have
            to pay a fixed sum annually to the temple.<a id="noteref_201"

            claimed favourable comparison. In the ceremonial of the

            "font-style: italic">Dâsî</span></span>, elements are not wanting
            which indicate a past quite the reverse of disreputable. The girl
            to be married is generally from six to eight years in age. The
            bridegroom is the presiding deity of the local temple. The
            ceremony is done at his house. The expenses of the celebration
            are supposed to be partly paid from his funds. To instance the
            practice at the Suchîndram temple, a <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Yôga</span></span> or meeting of the chief
            functionaries of the temple arranges the preliminaries. The girl
            to be wedded bathes and goes to the temple with two pieces of
            cloth, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">tâli</span></span>, betel, areca-nut, etc.
            These are placed by the priest at the feet of the image. The girl
            sits with the face towards the deity. The priest kindles the
            sacred fire and goes through all the rituals of the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tirukkalyânam</span></span> festival. He
            then initiates the bride into the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Panchâkshara
            mantra</span></span>, if in a Saiva temple, and the <span class=

            "font-style: italic">Ashtâkshara</span></span>, if in a Vaishnava
            temple. On behalf of the divine bridegroom, he presents one of
            the two cloths she has brought as offering and ties the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tâli</span></span> around her neck. The
            practice, how old it is not possible to say, is then to take her
            to her house where the usual marriage festivities are celebrated
            for four days. As in Brahminical marriages, the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Nalunku</span></span> ceremony, <span class=

            the rolling of a cocoanut by the bride to the bridegroom and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
            versa</span></span> a number of times to the accompaniment of
            music, is gone through, the temple priest playing the
            bridegroom's part. Thenceforth she becomes the wife of the deity
            in the sense that she formally and solemnly dedicates the rest of
            her life to his service with the same constancy and devotion that
            a faithful wife united in holy matrimony shows to her wedded
            lord. The life of a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dêvadâsî</span></span> bedecked with all the
            accomplishments that the muses could give was one of spotless
            purity. Even now she is maintained by the temple. She undertakes
            fasts in connection with the temple festivals, such as the seven
            days' fast for the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Apamârgam</span></span> ceremony. During the
            period of this fast, strict continence is enjoined; she is
            required to take only one meal, and that within the temple—in
            fact to live and behave at least for a term, in the manner
            ordained for her throughout life. Some of the details of her
            daily work seem interesting; she attends <span class="tei tei-pb"

            physically unfit for these duties, she is formally invalided by a

            they are considered to be married to the god, and their excesses
            are supposed to be caused and directed by him. Properly speaking,
            their libertinage should be confined to the male worshippers at

            inviolable, and during the period of her novitiate she is
            forbidden, if single, to enter the house of her parents, and, if

            neglected wife, from the ill-treatment of the lord and master;

            stool that belongs to the deity. The priests then anoint his head
            with a mystic decoction and invoke the god in a long and wild
            chorus. During the singing the youth, if he is acceptable to the
            deity, trembles violently, simulates convulsions, foams at the
            mouth, and dances in a frenzied style, sometimes for more than an
            hour. This is the proof that the god has taken possession of him.
            After that he has to remain in a temple without speaking for
            seven days and nights. At the end of that time, he is brought
            out, a priest opens his mouth to show that he may now use his
            tongue, a new name is given him, and he is fully ordained.<a id=

            Henceforth he is regarded as the priest and medium of the deity
            whom he serves, and the words which he utters in that morbid
            state of mental excitement which passes for divine inspiration,
            are accepted by the hearers as the very words of the god spoken
            by the mouth of the man.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212"

            crime which a priest committed in a state of frenzy used to
            remain unpunished, no doubt because the act was thought to be the
            act of the god. But this benefit of clergy was so much abused
            that under King Gezo the law had to be altered; and although,
            while he is still possessed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            he is now liable to punishment as soon as the divine spirit
            leaves him. Nevertheless on the whole among these people
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the person of a priest or priestess is
            sacred. Not only must a layman not lay hands on or insult one; he
            must be careful not even to knock one by accident, or jostle
            against one in the street. The Abbé Bouche relates<a id=

            that once when he was paying a visit to the chief of Agweh, one
            of the wives of the chief was brought into the house by four
            priestesses, her face bloody, and her body covered with stripes.
            She had been savagely flogged for having accidentally trodden
            upon the foot of one of them; and the chief not only dared not
            give vent to his anger, but had to give them a bottle of rum as a
            peace-offering.”</span><a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214"

            and beliefs in regard to the dedicated men and dedicated women,
            the priests and priestesses, are very similar. These persons are
            believed to be from time to time possessed or inspired by the
            deity whom they serve; and in that state they are consulted as
            oracles. They work themselves up to the necessary pitch of
            excitement by dancing to the music of drums; each god has his
            special hymn, sung to a special beat of the drum, and accompanied
            by a special dance. It is while thus dancing to the drums that
            the priest or priestess lets fall the oracular words in a
            croaking or guttural voice which the hearers take to be the voice
            of the god. Hence dancing has an important place in the education
            of priests and priestesses; they are trained in it for months
            before they may perform in public. These mouthpieces of the deity
            are consulted in almost every concern of life and are handsomely
            paid for their services.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215"

            be paid for a priestess. The reason appears to be that a
            priestess belongs to the god she serves, and therefore cannot
            become the property of a man, as would <span class="tei tei-pb"

            prohibition extends to marriage only, and a priestess is not
            debarred from sexual commerce. The children of a priest or
            priestess are not ordinarily educated for the priestly
            profession, one generation being usually passed over, and the
            grandchildren selected. Priestesses are ordinarily most
            licentious, and custom allows them to gratify their passions with
            any man who may chance to take their fancy.”</span><a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> The
            ranks of the hereditary priesthood are constantly recruited by
            persons who devote themselves or who are devoted by their
            relations or masters to the profession. Men, women, and even
            children can thus become members of the priesthood. If a mother
            has lost several of her children by death, she will not
            uncommonly vow to devote the next born to the service of the
            gods; for in this way she hopes to save the child's life. So when
            the child is born it is set apart for the priesthood, and on
            arriving at maturity generally fulfils the vow made by the mother
            and becomes a priest or priestess. At the ceremony of ordination
            the votary has to prove his or her vocation for the sacred life
            in the usual way by falling into or simulating convulsions,
            dancing frantically to the beat of drums, and speaking in a
            hoarse unnatural voice words which are deemed to be the utterance
            of the deity temporarily lodged in the body of the man or

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in
            Africa, and sometimes if not regularly in India, the sacred
            prostitutes attached to temples are regarded as the wives of the
            god, and their excesses are excused on the ground that the women
            are not themselves, but that they act under the influence of
            divine inspiration. This is in substance the explanation which I
            have given of the custom of sacred prostitution as it was
            practised in antiquity by the peoples <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of Western Asia. In their licentious
            intercourse at the temples the women, whether maidens or matrons
            or professional harlots, imitated the licentious conduct of a
            great goddess of fertility for the purpose of ensuring the
            fruitfulness of fields and trees, of man and beast; and in
            discharging this sacred and important function the women were
            probably supposed, like their West African sisters, to be
            actually possessed by the goddess. The hypothesis at least
            explains all the facts in a simple and natural manner; and in
            assuming that women could be married to gods it assumes a
            principle which we know to have been recognized in Babylon,
            Assyria, and Egypt.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href=

            Babylon a woman regularly slept in the great bed of Bel or
            Marduk, which stood in his temple on the summit of a lofty
            pyramid; and it was believed that the god chose her from all the
            women of Babylon and slept with her in the bed. However, unlike
            the Indian and West African wives of gods, this spouse of the
            Babylonian deity is reported by Herodotus to have been
            chaste.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> Yet
            we may doubt whether she was so; for these wives or perhaps
            paramours of Bel are probably to be identified with the wives or
            votaries of Marduk mentioned in the code of Hammurabi, and we
            know from the code that female votaries of the gods might be
            mothers and married to men.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220"

            Babylon the sun-god Shamash as well as Marduk had human wives

            the example of West Africa warns us that a formal respect shown

            all events we know that this was so at the sanctuary of the Moon
            among the Albanians of the Caucasus. The sanctuary owned church
            lands of great extent peopled by sacred slaves, and it was ruled
            by a high-priest, who ranked next after the king. Many of these
            slaves were inspired by the deity and prophesied; and when one of
            them had been for some time in this state of divine frenzy,
            wandering alone in the forest, the high-priest had him caught,
            bound with a sacred chain, and maintained in luxury for a year.
            Then the poor wretch was led out, anointed with unguents, and
            sacrificed with other victims to the Moon. The mode of sacrifice
            was this. A man took a sacred spear, and thrust it through the
            victim's side to the heart. As he staggered and fell, the rest
            observed him closely and drew omens from the manner of his fall.
            Then the body was dragged or carried away to a certain place,
            where all his fellows stood upon it by way of purification.<a id=

            this custom the prophet, or rather the maniac, was plainly

            can hardly therefore be deemed improbable that at other
            sanctuaries of Western Asia, where sacred men were kept, these
            ministers of religion should have discharged a similar prophetic
            function, even though they did not share the tragic <span class=

            Albanian prophet. Nor was the influence of these Asiatic prophets
            confined to Asia. In Sicily the spark which kindled the
            devastating Servile War was struck by a Syrian slave, who
            simulated the prophetic ecstasy in order to rouse his
            fellow-slaves to arms in the name of the Syrian goddess. To
            inflame still more his inflammatory words this ancient Mahdi
            ingeniously interlarded them with real fire and smoke, which by a
            common conjurer's trick he breathed from his lips.<a id=

            word which may be understood to imply that his special function
            was divination rather than prophecy in the sense of prediction.
            Be that as it may, prophecy of the Hebrew type has not been
            limited to Israel; it is indeed a phenomenon of almost world-wide
            occurrence; in many lands and in many ages the wild, whirling
            words of frenzied men and women have been accepted as the
            utterances of an indwelling deity.<a id="noteref_242" name=

            What does distinguish Hebrew prophecy from all others is that the
            genius of a few members of the profession wrested this vulgar but
            powerful instrument from baser uses, and by wielding it in the
            interest of a high morality rendered a service of incalculable
            value to humanity. That is indeed the glory of Israel, but it is
            not the side of prophecy with which we are here concerned.</p>

            have been in vogue at Byblus, the sacred city of Adonis,
            centuries before the life-time of the earliest Hebrew prophet
            whose writings have come down to us. When the Egyptian traveller,
            Wen-Ammon, was lingering in the port of Byblus, under the King's
            orders to quit the place, the spirit of God came on one of the
            royal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg

            the King should receive the Egyptian stranger as a messenger sent
            from the god Ammon.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href=

            god who thus took possession of the page and spoke through him
            was probably Adonis, the god of the city. With regard to the
            office of these royal pages we have no information; but as
            ministers of a sacred king and liable to be inspired by the
            deity, they would naturally be themselves sacred; in fact they

            would confirm the conclusion to which the foregoing investigation
            points, namely, that originally no sharp line of distinction
            existed between the prophets and the <span lang="he" class=

            other words, they were inspired mediums, men in whom the god
            manifested himself from time to time by word and deed, in short
            temporary incarnations of the deity. But while the prophets roved
            freely about the country, the <span lang="he" class=

            regularly attached to a sanctuary; and among the duties which
            they performed at the shrines there were clearly some which
            revolted the conscience of men imbued with a purer morality. What
            these duties were, we may surmise partly from the behaviour of

            in filthy garments, or without clothing. Since they are regarded
            as intoxicated by deity, the most dignified men, and of the
            highest standing among the Moslems, submit to utter indecent
            language at their bidding without rebuke, and ignorant Moslem
            women do not shrink from their approach, because in their
            superstitious belief they attribute to them, as men possessed by
            God, a divine authority which they dare not resist. Such an
            attitude of compliance may be exceptional, but there are more
            than rumours of its existence. These <span class=

            a hope of obtaining offspring by them. For in Syria it is still
            believed that even dead saints can beget children on barren
            women, who accordingly resort to their shrines in order to obtain
            the wish of their hearts. For example, at the Baths of Solomon in
            Northern Palestine, blasts of hot air escape from the ground; and
            one of them, named Abu Rabah, is a famous resort of childless
            wives who wish to satisfy their maternal longings. They let the
            hot air stream up over their bodies and really believe that
            children born to them after such a visit are begotten by the
            saint of the shrine.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href=

            the saint who enjoys the highest reputation in this respect is
            St. George. He reveals himself at his shrines which are scattered
            all over the country; at each of them there is a tomb or the
            likeness of a tomb. The most celebrated of these sanctuaries is
            at Kalat el Hosn in Northern Syria. Barren women of all sects,
            including Moslems, resort to it. <span class="tei tei-q">“There
            are many natives who shrug their shoulders when this shrine is
            mentioned in connection with women. But it is doubtless true that
            many do not know what seems to be its true character, and who
            think that the most puissant saint, as they believe, in the world
            can give them sons.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“But the true

            Multitudes of men and women, in fact, whose mothers had resorted
            to holy places in order to procure offspring, would be regarded
            as the actual children of the god and would be named accordingly.
            Hence Hannah called her infant Samuel, which means <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“name of God”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“his
            name is God”</span>;<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> and
            probably she sincerely believed that the child was actually
            begotten in her womb by the deity.<a id="noteref_256" name=

            dedication of such children to the service of God at the
            sanctuary was merely giving back the divine son to the divine
            father. Similarly in West Africa, when a woman has got a child at
            the shrine of Agbasia, the god who alone bestows offspring on
            women, she dedicates him or her as a sacred slave to the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in the
            Syrian beliefs and customs of to-day we probably have the clue to
            the religious prostitution practised in the very same regions in
            antiquity. Then as now women looked to the local god, the Baal or
            Adonis of old, the Abu Rabah or St. George of to-day, to satisfy
            the natural craving of a woman's heart; and then as now,
            apparently, the part <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg
            080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of the local god was played by sacred men, who in personating him
            may often have sincerely believed that they were acting under
            divine inspiration, and that the functions which they discharged
            were necessary for the fertility of the land as well as for the
            propagation of the human species. The purifying influence of
            Christianity and Mohammedanism has restricted such customs within
            narrow limits; even under Turkish rule they are now only carried
            on in holes and corners. Yet if the practice has dwindled, the
            principle which it embodies appears to be fundamentally the same;
            it is a desire for the continuance of the species, and a belief
            that an object so natural and legitimate can be accomplished by
            divine power manifesting itself in the bodies of men and
            women.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The belief in
            the physical fatherhood of God has not been confined to Syria in
            ancient and modern times. Elsewhere many men have been counted
            the sons of God in the most literal sense of the word, being
            supposed to have been begotten by his holy spirit in the wombs of
            mortal women. Here I shall merely illustrate the creed by a few
            examples drawn from classical antiquity.<a id="noteref_258" name=

            Thus in order to obtain offspring women used to resort to the
            great sanctuary of Aesculapius, situated in a beautiful upland
            valley, to which a path, winding through a long wooded gorge,
            leads from the bay of Epidaurus. Here the women slept in the holy
            place and were visited in dreams by a serpent; and the children
            to whom they afterwards gave birth were believed to have been
            begotten by the reptile.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>
            That the serpent was supposed to be the god himself seems
            certain; for Aesculapius repeatedly appeared in the form of a
            serpent,<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href=
            "#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> and
            live serpents were kept and fed in his sanctuaries for the
            healing of the sick, being no doubt regarded as his
            incarnations.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href=
            "#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Hence the children born to women who had <span class="tei tei-pb"

            were probably fathered on the serpent-god. Many celebrated men in
            classical antiquity were thus promoted to the heavenly hierarchy
            by similar legends of a miraculous birth. The famous Aratus of
            Sicyon was certainly believed by his countrymen to be a son of
            Aesculapius; his mother is said to have got him in intercourse
            with a serpent.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>
            Probably she slept either in the shrine of Aesculapius at Sicyon,
            where a figurine of her was shown seated on a serpent,<a id=
            "noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> or
            perhaps in the more secluded sanctuary of the god at Titane, not
            many miles off, where the sacred serpents crawled among ancient
            cypresses on the hill-top which overlooks the narrow green valley
            of the Asopus with the white turbid river rushing in its
            depths.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href=

            There, under the shadow of the cypresses, with the murmur of the
            Asopus in her ears, the mother of Aratus may have conceived, or
            fancied she conceived, the future deliverer of his country.
            Again, the mother of Augustus is said to have got him by
            intercourse with a serpent in a temple of Apollo; hence the
            emperor was reputed to be the son of that god.<a id="noteref_265"

            Similar tales were told of the Messenian hero Aristomenes,

            into a snake as soon as his body rots; and the snake goes to his
            children's kraal to look after them. The Masai in consequence do
            not kill their sacred snakes, and if a woman sees one in her hut,
            she pours some milk on the ground for it to lick, after which it

            the Nandi of British East Africa, <span class="tei tei-q">“if a
            snake goes on to the woman's bed, it may not be killed, as it is
            believed that it personifies the spirit of a deceased ancestor or
            relation, and that it has been sent to intimate to the woman that
            her next child will be born safely. Milk is put on the ground for
            it to drink, and the man or his wife says: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘... If thou wantest the call, come, thou art being
            called.’</span> It is then allowed to leave the house. If a snake

            This association of the serpent, regarded as an incarnation of
            the dead, both with the marriage bed and with the huts of young
            people, points to a belief that the deceased person who is
            incarnate in the snake may be born again as a human child into
            the world. Again, among the Suk of British East Africa
            <span class="tei tei-q">“it seems to be generally believed that a

            Milk is poured on to its tracks, and a little meat and tobacco
            placed on the ground for it to eat. It is believed that if no
            food is given to the snake one or all of the members of the
            household will die. It, however, may none the less be killed if
            encountered outside the house, and if at the time of its death it

            the Baganda the python god Selwanga had his temple on the shore
            of the lake Victoria Nyanza, where he dwelt in the form of a live
            python. The temple was a hut of the ordinary conical shape with a
            round hole in the wall, through which the sinuous deity crawled
            out and in at his pleasure. A woman lived in the temple, and it
            was her duty to feed the python daily with fresh milk from a
            wooden bowl, which she held out to the divine reptile while he
            drained it. The serpent was thought to be the giver of children;
            hence young couples living in the neighbourhood always came to
            the shrine to ensure the blessing of the god on their union, and
            childless women repaired from long distances to be relieved by
            him from the curse of barrenness.<a id="noteref_285" name=

            Apparently superstition saw in these serpents the souls of the
            dead men. In Greek religion the serpent was indeed the regular
            symbol or attribute of the worshipful dead,<a id="noteref_291"

            we can hardly doubt that the early Greeks, like the Zulus and
            other African tribes at the present day, really believed the soul
            of the departed to be lodged in the reptile. The sacred serpent
            which lived in the Erechtheum at Athens, and was fed with
            honey-cakes once a month, may have been supposed to house the
            soul of the dead king Erechtheus, who had reigned in his lifetime
            on the same spot.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href=

            were intended to be drunk by serpents as the embodiments of the
            deceased; on two tombstones found at Tegea a man and a woman are
            respectively represented holding out to a serpent a cup which may

            such times it was thought desirable to appease them with
            offerings. Sometimes, however, it is not the dead but the Earth

            fertilized by the ashes after the breaking of the rains.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“One explanation of their refusal to till

            China the disturbance caused to the earth-spirits by the
            operations of digging and ploughing was so very serious that
            Chinese philosophy appears to have contemplated a plan for
            allowing the perturbed spirits a close time by forbidding the
            farmer to put his spade or his plough into the ground except on
            certain days, when the earth-spirits were either not at home or
            kindly consented to put up with some temporary inconvenience for
            the good of man. This we may infer from a passage in a Chinese
            author who wrote in the first century of our era. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“If it is true,”</span> he says, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“that the spirits who inhabit the soil object to it
            being disturbed and dug up, then it is proper for us to select
            special good days for digging ditches and ploughing our fields.
            (But this is never done); it therefore follows that the spirits
            of the soil, even though really annoyed when it is disturbed,
            pass over such an offence if man commits it without evil intent.
            As he commits it merely to ensure his rest and comfort, the act
            cannot possibly excite any anger against him in the perfect heart
            of those spirits; and this being the case, they will not visit
            him with misfortune even if he do not choose auspicious days for
            it. But if we believe that the earth-spirits cannot excuse man on
            account of the object he pursues, and detest him for annoying
            them by disturbing the ground, what advantage then can he derive
            from selecting proper days for doing so?”</span><a id=

            What advantage indeed? In that case the only logical conclusion
            is, with the Indian prophet, to forbid agriculture altogether, as
            an impious encroachment on the spiritual world. Few peoples,
            however, who have once contracted the habit of agriculture

            concession which they are willing to make to religion in the

            When Ratumaimbulu, the god who made fruit-trees to blossom and
            bear fruit, came once a year to Fiji, the people had to live very
            quietly for a month lest they should disturb him at his important
            work. During this time they might not plant nor build nor sail
            about nor go to war; indeed most kinds of work were forbidden.
            The priests announced the time of the god's arrival and

            explaining that his wife wished to become a mother. The
            good-natured officer complied with his request and watched the
            woman. She continued to dig till she had uncovered a little
            skeleton, the remains of her first-born, which she tenderly
            embraced, humbly entreating the dead child to enter into her and

            burnt, or a child born feet first had been buried. Women were
            careful to throw grass or sticks on such a spot, for by so doing

            fear of being got with child by such ghosts was not confined to
            married women, it was shared by all women alike, whether young or
            old, whether married or single; and all of them sought to avert

            Baganda women imagined that without the help of the other sex
            they could be impregnated not only by these unpleasant ghosts but
            also by the flower of the banana. If while a woman was busy in
            her garden under the shadow of the banana trees, a great purple
            bloom chanced to fall from one of the trees on her back or
            shoulders, it was quite enough, in the opinion of the Baganda, to
            get her with child; and were a wife accused of adultery because
            she gave birth to a child who could not possibly have been
            begotten by her husband, she had only to father the infant on a
            banana flower to be honourably acquitted of the charge. The
            reason why this remarkable property was ascribed to the bloom of
            the banana would seem to be that ghosts of ancestors were thought
            to haunt banana groves, and that the afterbirths of children,
            which the Baganda regarded as twins of the children, were
            commonly buried at the root of the trees.<a id="noteref_317"

            What more natural than that a ghost should lurk in each flower,

            the Punjaub this belief in the reincarnation of dead infants

            at the threshold, in the belief that it would facilitate the
            return of the soul to the mother. The practice is also in vogue
            in the Kangra District, where the body is buried in front of the
            back door. In some places it is believed that, if the child dies
            in infancy and the mother drops her milk for two or three days on
            the ground, the soul of the child comes back to be born again.
            For this purpose milk diluted with water is placed in a small
            earthen pot and offered to the dead child's spirit for three
            consecutive evenings. There is also a belief in the Ambala and
            Gujrat Districts that if jackals and dogs dig out the dead body
            of the child and bring it towards the town or village, it means
            that the child will return to its mother, but if they take it to
            some other side, the soul will reincarnate in some other family.
            For this purpose, the second day after the infant's death, the
            mother goes out early in the morning to see whether the dogs have
            brought the body towards the village. When the child is being
            taken away for burial the mother cuts off and preserves a piece
            of its garment with a view to persuade the soul to return to her.
            Barren women or those who have lost children in infancy tear a
            piece off the clothing of a dead child and stitch it to their
            wearing apparel, believing that the soul of the child will return
            to them instead of its own mother. On this account, people take
            great care not to lose the clothes of dead children, and some
            bury them in the house.”</span><a id="noteref_319" name=

            and the next baby born in the family with a similar mark is

            This last custom explains the widely diffused story of virgins

            thought to contain the soul of a dead person, which thus passed
            into the virgin's womb and was born again as an infant. Among the
            South Slavs childless women often resort to a grave in which a
            pregnant woman is buried. There they bite some grass from the
            grave, invoke the deceased by name, and beg her to give them the
            fruit of her womb. After that they take a little of the mould

            Apparently they imagine that the soul of the unborn infant is in
            the grass or the mould and will pass from it into their body.</p>

            some islands of Southern Melanesia the natives appear similarly
            to believe that sexual intercourse is not necessary to
            impregnation, and that a woman can conceive through the simple
            passage into her womb of a spirit-animal or a spirit-fruit
            without the help of a man. In the island of Mota, one of the
            Banks' group, <span class="tei tei-q">“the course of events is
            usually as follows: a woman sitting down in her garden or in the
            bush or on the shore finds an animal or fruit in her loincloth.
            She takes it up and carries it to the village, where she asks the
            meaning of the appearance. The people say that she will give
            birth to a child who will have the characters of this animal or
            even, it appeared, would be himself or herself the animal. The
            woman then takes the creature back to the place where she had
            found it and places it in its proper home; if it is a land animal
            on the land; if a water animal in the pool or stream from which
            it had probably come. She builds up a wall round it and goes to
            feed and visit it every day. After a time the animal will
            disappear, and it is believed that that is because the animal has
            at the time of its disappearance entered into the woman. It
            seemed quite clear that there was no belief in physical
            impregnation on the part of the animal, nor of the entry of a
            material object in the form of the animal into her womb, but so
            far as I could gather, an animal found in this way was regarded
            as more or less supernatural, a spirit animal and not one
            material, from the beginning. It has happened in the memory of an
            old man now living in Mota that a woman who has found an animal
            in her loincloth has carried it carefully in her closed hands to
            the village, but that when she opened her hands to show it to the
            people, the animal has gone, and in this case it was believed
            that the entry had taken place while the woman was on her way
            from the bush to the village.... When the child is born it is
            regarded as being in some sense the animal or fruit which had
            been found and tended by the mother. The child may not eat the
            animal during the whole of its life, and if it does so, will
            suffer serious illness, if not death. If it is a fruit which has
            been found, the child may not eat this fruit or touch the tree
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name=
            "Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on which it grows,
            the latter restriction remaining in those cases in which the
            fruit is inedible.... I inquired into the idea at the bottom of
            the prohibition of the animal as food, and it appeared to be that
            the person would be eating himself. It seemed that the act would
            be regarded as a kind of cannibalism. It was evident that there
            is a belief in the most intimate relation between the person and
            all individuals of the species with which he is
            identified.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“A further aspect of the belief in the animal nature
            of a child is that it partakes of the physical and mental
            characters of the animal with which it is identified. Thus, if
            the animal found has been a sea-snake, and this is a frequent
            occurrence, the child would be weak, indolent and slow; if an
            eel, there will be a similar disposition; if a hermit crab, the
            child will be hot-tempered; if a flying fox, it will also be
            hot-tempered and the body will be dark; if a brush turkey, the
            disposition will be good; if a lizard, the child will be soft and
            gentle; if a rat, thoughtless, hasty and intemperate. If the
            object found has been a fruit, here also the child will partake
            of its nature. In the case of a wild Malay apple (<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">malmalagaviga</span></span>) the child will
            have a big belly, and a person with this condition will be asked,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do you come from the <span class=

            be allowed to eat it. Here again the child is believed to have
            the characters of the animal, and two instances given were that a
            child identified with a yellow crab will have a good disposition
            and be of a light colour, while if a hermit crab has been found,
            the child will be angry and disagreeable. In this island a woman

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout a
            large part of Australia, particularly in the Centre, the North,
            and the West, the aborigines hold that the commerce of the human
            sexes is not necessary to the production of children; indeed many
            of them go further and deny that sexual intercourse is the real
            cause of the propagation of the species. Among the Arunta,
            Kaitish, Luritcha, Ilpirra and other tribes, who roam the barren
            steppes of Central Australia, it appears to be a universal
            article of belief that every person is the reincarnation of a
            deceased ancestor, and that the souls of the dead pass directly
            into the wombs of women, who give them birth without the need of
            commerce with the other sex. They think that the spirits of the
            departed gather and dwell at particular spots, marked by a
            natural feature such as a rock or a tree, and that from these
            lurking-places they dart out and enter the bodies of passing
            women or girls. When a woman feels her womb quickened, she knows
            that a spirit has made its way into her from the nearest abode of
            the dead. This is their regular explanation of conception and
            childbirth. <span class="tei tei-q">“The natives, one and all in
            these tribes, believe that the child is the direct result of the
            entrance into the mother of an ancestral spirit individual. They
            have no idea of procreation as being associated with sexual
            intercourse, and firmly believe that children can be born without
            this taking place.”</span><a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329"

            the places where the remote ancestors of the dream-time are said
            to have passed into the ground; that is, they are the places
            where the forefathers of the tribe are supposed to have died or
            to have been buried. For example, in the Warramunga tribe the
            ancestor of the Black-snake clan is said to have left many
            spirits of Black-snake children in the rocks and trees which
            border a certain creek. Hence no woman at the present day dares
            to strike one of these trees with an axe, being quite convinced
            that the blow would release one of the spirit-children, who would
            at once enter her body. They imagine that the spirit is no larger
            than a grain of sand, and that it enters the woman through her
            navel and grows into a child in her womb.<a id="noteref_330"

            Again, at several places in the wide territory of the Arunta
            tribe there are certain stones which are in like manner thought
            to be the abode of souls awaiting rebirth. Hence the stones are
            called <span class="tei tei-q">“child-stones.”</span> In one of
            them there is a hole through which the spirit-children look out
            for passing women, and it is firmly believed that a visit to the
            stone would result in conception. If a young woman is obliged to
            pass near the stone and does not wish to have a child, she will
            carefully disguise her youth, pulling a wry face and hobbling
            along on a stick. She will bend herself double like a very old
            woman, and imitating the cracked voice of age she will say,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't come to me, I am an old
            woman.”</span> Nay, it is thought that women may conceive by the
            stone without visiting it. If a man and his wife both wish for a
            child, the husband will tie his hair-girdle round the stone, rub
            it, and mutter a direction to the spirits to give heed to his
            wife. And it is believed that by performing a similar ceremony a
            malicious man can cause women and even children at a distance to
            be pregnant.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href=

            the Mungarai say that in the far past time their old ancestors
            walked about the country, making all the natural features of the
            landscape and leaving spirit-children behind them where they
            stopped. These children emanated from the bodies of the
            ancestors, and they still wait at various spots looking out for
            women into whom they may go and be born. For example, near
            McMinn's bar on the Roper River there is a large gum tree full of
            spirit-children, who all belong to one particular totem and are
            always agog to enter into women of that totem. Again, at Crescent
            Lagoon an ancestor, who belonged to the thunder totem, deposited
            numbers of spirit-children; and if a woman of the Gnaritjbellan
            subclass so much as dips her foot in the water, one of the
            spirit-children passes up her leg and into her body and in due
            time is born as a child, who has thunder for its totem. Or if the
            woman stoops and drinks water, one of the sprites will enter her
            through the mouth. Again, there are lagoons along the Roper River
            where red lilies grow; and the water is full of spirit-children
            which were deposited there by a kangaroo man. So when women of
            the Gnaritjbellan subclass wade into the water to gather lilies,
            little sprites swarm up their legs and are born as kangaroo
            children. Again, in the territory of the Nullakun tribe there is
            a certain spring where a man once deposited spirit-children of
            the rainbow totem; and to this day when a woman of the right
            totem comes to drink at the spring, the spirit of a rainbow child
            will dart into her and be born. Once more, in the territory of
            the Yungman tribe the trees and stones near Elsey Creek are full
            of spirit-children who belong to the sugar-bag (honeycomb) totem;
            and these sugar-bag children are constantly entering into the
            right women and being born into the world.<a id="noteref_333"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natives of
            the Tully River in Queensland do not recognize sexual intercourse
            as a cause of conception in women, though curiously enough they
            do recognize it as the cause of conception in all animals, and
            pride themselves on their superiority to the brutes in that they
            are not indebted for the continuance of their species to such low
            and vulgar means. The true causes of conception in a woman,
            according to them, are four in number. First, she may have
            received a particular species of black bream from a man whom the
            European in his ignorance would call the father; this she may
            have roasted and sat over the fire inhaling the savoury smell of
            the roast fish. That is quite sufficient to get her with child.
            Or, secondly, she may have gone out on purpose to catch a certain
            kind of bull-frog, and if she succeeds in capturing it, that
            again is a full and satisfactory explanation of her pregnancy.
            Thirdly, some man may have told her to conceive a child, and the
            mere command produces the desired effect. Or, fourth and lastly,
            she may have simply dreamed that the child was put into her, and
            the dream necessarily works its own fulfilment. Whatever white
            men may think about the matter, these are the real causes why
            babies are born among the blacks on the Tully River.<a id=

            About Cape Bedford in Queensland the natives believe that babies
            are sent by certain long-haired spirits, with two sets of eyes in
            the front and back of their heads, who live in the dense scrub
            and underwood. The children are made in the far west where the
            sun goes down, and they are made not in the form of infants but
            full grown; but on their passage from the sunset land to the
            wombs they are changed into the shape of spur-winged plovers, if
            they are girls, or of pretty snakes, if they are boys. So when
            the cry of a plover is heard by night, the blacks prick up their
            ears and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallo! there is a baby
            somewhere about.”</span> And if a woman is out in the bush
            searching for food and sees one of the pretty snakes, which are
            really baby boys on the look out for mothers, she will call out
            to her mates, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
            103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            they will come running and turn over stones, and leaves, and logs
            in the search for the snake; and if they cannot find it they know
            that it has gone into the woman and that she will soon give birth
            to a baby boy.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href=

            the Pennefather River in Queensland the being who puts babies
            into women is called Anje-a. He takes a lump of mud out of one of
            the mangrove swamps, moulds it into the shape of an infant, and
            insinuates it into a woman's womb. You can never see him, for he
            lives in the depths of the woods, among the rocks, and along the
            mangrove swamps; but sometimes you can hear him laughing there to
            himself, and when you hear him you may know that he has got a
            baby ready for somebody.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336"

            Among the tribes of the Cairns district in North Queensland
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the acceptance of food from a man by a
            woman was not merely regarded as a marriage ceremony, but as the

            kills game or collects other food, he gives it to his wife and

            similar belief that conception is caused by the food which a
            woman eats is held by some tribes of Western Australia. On this
            subject Mr. A. R. Brown reports as follows: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“In the Ingarda tribe at the mouth of the Gascoyne
            River, I found a belief that a child is the product of some food
            of which the mother has partaken just before her first sickness
            in pregnancy. My principal informant on this subject told me that
            his father had speared a small animal called <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">bandaru</span></span>, probably a bandicoot,
            but now extinct in this neighbourhood. His mother ate the animal,
            with the result that she gave birth to my informant. He showed me
            the mark in his side where, as he said, he had been speared by
            his father before being eaten by his mother. A little girl was
            pointed out to me as being the result of her mother eating a
            domestic cat, and her brother was said to have been produced from
            a bustard.... The bustard was one of the totems of the father of
            these two children and, therefore, of the children themselves.
            This, however, seems to have been purely accidental. In most
            cases the animal to which conception is due is not one of the
            father's totems. The species that is thus connected with an
            individual by birth is not in any way sacred to him. He may kill
            or eat it; he may marry a woman whose conceptional animal is of
            the same species, and he is not by the accident of his birth
            entitled to take part in the totemic ceremonies connected with
            it.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I found traces of this same belief in a number of
            tribes north of the Ingarda, but everywhere the belief seemed to
            be sporadic; that is to say, some persons believed in it and
            others did not. Some individuals could tell the animal or plant
            from which they or others were descended, while others did not
            know or in some cases denied that conception was so caused. There
            were to be met with, however, some beliefs of the same character.
            A woman of the Buduna tribe said that native women nowadays bear
            half-caste children because they eat bread made of white flour.
            Many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg

            of the men believed that conception is due to sexual intercourse,
            but as these natives have been for many years in contact with the
            whites this cannot be regarded as satisfactory evidence of the
            nature of their original beliefs.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“In some tribes further to the north I found a more
            interesting and better organised system of beliefs. In the
            Kariera, Ñamal, and Injibandi tribes the conception of a child is
            believed to be due to the agency of a particular man, who is not
            the father. This man is the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span> of the child when it is
            born. There were three different accounts of how the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span> produces conception,
            each of them given to me on several different occasions.
            According to the first, the man gives some food, either animal or
            vegetable, to the woman, and she eats this and becomes pregnant.
            According to the second, the man when he is out hunting kills an
            animal, preferably a kangaroo or an emu, and as it is dying he
            tells its spirit or ghost to go to a particular woman. The spirit
            of the dead animal goes into the woman and is born as a child.
            The third account is very similar to the last. A hunter, when he
            has killed a kangaroo or an emu, takes a portion of the fat of
            the dead animal which he places on one side. This fat turns into
            what we may speak of as a spirit-baby, and follows the man to his
            camp. When the man is asleep at night the spirit-baby comes to
            him and he directs it to enter a certain woman who thus becomes
            pregnant. When the child is born the man acknowledges that he
            sent it, and becomes its <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span>. In practically every
            case that I examined, some forty in all, the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span> of a man or woman was a
            person standing to him or her in the relation of father's brother
            own or tribal. In one case a man had a <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span> who was his father's
            sister. The duties of a man to his <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span> are very vaguely
            defined. I was told that a man <span class="tei tei-q">‘looks
            after’</span> his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span>, that is, performs
            small services for him, and, perhaps, gives him food. The
            conceptional animal or plant is not the totem of either the child
            or the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">wororu</span></span>. The child has no
            particular magical connection with the animal from which he is
            derived. In a very large number of cases that animal is either
            the kangaroo or the emu.”</span><a id="noteref_339" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it
            appears that a childlike ignorance as to the physical process of
            procreation still prevails to some extent among certain rude
            races of mankind, who are accordingly driven to account for it in
            various fanciful ways such as might content the curiosity of
            children. We may safely assume that formerly a like ignorance was
            far more widely spread than it is now; indeed in the long ages
            which elapsed before any portion of mankind emerged from
            savagery, it is probable that the true cause of childbirth was
            universally unknown, and that people made shift to explain the
            mystery by some such theories as are still current among the
            savage or barbarous races of Central Africa, Melanesia, and
            Australia. A little reflection on the conditions of savage life
            may satisfy us that the ignorance is by no means so surprising as
            it may seem at first sight to a civilized observer, or, to put it
            otherwise, that the true cause of the birth of children is not
            nearly so obvious as we are apt to think. Among low savages, such
            as all men were originally, it is customary for boys and girls to
            cohabit freely with each other under the age of puberty, so that
            they are familiar with a commerce of the sexes which is not and
            cannot be attended with the birth of children. It is, therefore,
            not very wonderful that they should confidently deny the
            connexion of sexual intercourse with the production of offspring.
            Again, the long interval of time which divides the act of
            conception from the first manifest symptoms of pregnancy might
            easily disguise from the heedless savage the vital relation
            between the two. These considerations may remove or lessen the
            hesitation which civilized man naturally feels at admitting that
            a considerable part or even the whole of his species should ever
            have doubted or denied what seems to him one of the most obvious
            and elementary truths of nature.<a id="noteref_340" name=

            Is it not natural to suppose that the stock and stone which the
            superstitious Israelites regarded as their father and mother were
            the sacred stock (<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="he"><span style=

            "he"><span style="font-style: italic">massebah</span></span>) of
            the sanctuary, and that the children born of the loose
            intercourse of the sexes at these places were believed to be the
            offspring or emanations of these uncouth but worshipful idols in
            which, as in the sacred trees and stones of Central Australia,
            the souls of the dead may have been supposed to await rebirth? On
            this view the sacred men and women who actually begot

            the men perhaps personating the sacred stock, which appears to
            have been a tree stripped of its branches, and the women
            personating the sacred stone, which seems to have been in the
            shape of a cone, an obelisk, or a pillar.<a id="noteref_343"

            Jerusalem and the sea. Here the English excavations have laid

            had accumulated over the floor of the temple were found vast
            numbers of male emblems rudely carved out of soft limestone; and
            tablets of terra-cotta, representing in low relief the
            mother-goddess, were discovered throughout the strata. These
            objects were no doubt votive-offerings presented by the

            in large quantities raises a strong presumption that the

            above all sources of fertility. The supposition is further
            strengthened by a very remarkable discovery. Under the floor of
            the temple were found the bones of many new-born children, none
            more than a week old, buried in large jars. None of these little

            birth, and that they were buried by their parents in the

          vestiges of that gloomy rite are clearer in Phoenicia itself and in
          the Phoenician colonies, which lay more remote from the highways of
          Grecian commerce. We know that the Semites were in the habit of
          sacrificing some of their children, generally the first-born,
          either as a tribute regularly due to the deity or to appease his

          would no doubt transmit his divinity to his offspring; and further,
          that the same sacrifice is said to have been performed in the same
          way by the divine founder of Byblus, the great seat of the worship
          of Adonis.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href=

          suggests that the human representatives of Adonis formerly perished
          in the flames. At all events, a custom of periodically burning the
          chief god of the city in effigy appears to have prevailed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name=
          "Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> at Tyre and in the
          Tyrian colonies down to a late time, and the effigy may well have
          been a later substitute for a man. For Melcarth, the great god of
          Tyre, was identified by the Greeks with Hercules,<a id=
          "noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class=

          is said to have burned himself to death on a great pyre, ascending

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> The
          common Greek legend, immortalized by Sophocles, laid the scene of
          the fiery tragedy on the top of Mount Oeta, but another version
          transferred it significantly to Tyre itself.<a id="noteref_352"
          name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class=

          Combined with the other evidence which I shall adduce, this latter
          tradition raises a strong presumption that an effigy of Hercules,
          or rather of Melcarth, was regularly burned at a great festival in
          Tyre. That festival may have been the one known as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the awakening of Hercules,”</span> which was held in
          the month of Peritius, answering nearly to January.<a id=
          "noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> The
          name of the festival suggests that the dramatic representation of
          the death of the god on the pyre was followed by a semblance of his
          resurrection. The mode in which the resurrection was supposed to be
          effected is perhaps indicated by the statement of a Greek writer
          that the Phoenicians used to sacrifice quails to Hercules, because
          Hercules on his journey to Libya had been slain by Typhon and
          brought to life again by Iolaus, who held a quail under his nose:
          the dead god snuffed at the bird and revived.<a id="noteref_354"
          name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>
          According to another account Iolaus burnt a quail alive, and the
          dead hero, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
          112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          loved quails, came to life again through the savoury smell of the
          roasted bird.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href=
          "#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> This
          latter tradition seems to point to a custom of burning the quails
          alive in the Phoenician sacrifices to Melcarth.<a id="noteref_356"
          name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> A
          festival of the god's resurrection might appropriately be held in
          spring, when the quails migrate northwards across the Mediterranean
          in great bands, and immense numbers of them are netted for the
          market.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href=
          "#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> In
          the month of March the birds return to Palestine by myriads in a
          single night, and remain to breed in all the open plains, marshes,
          and cornfields.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a>
          Certainly a close connexion seems to have subsisted between quails
          and Melcarth; for legend ran that Asteria, the mother of the Tyrian
          Hercules, that is, of Melcarth, was transformed into a quail.<a id=

          was an ancient, famous, and wealthy sanctuary of Hercules, the
          Tyrian Melcarth. Indeed the god was said to be buried on the spot.
          No image stood in his temple, but a perpetual fire burned on the
          altar, and incense was offered by white-robed priests, with bare
          feet and shorn heads, who were bound to chastity. Neither women nor
          pigs might pollute the holy place by their presence. In later times
          many distinguished Romans went on pilgrimage to this remote shrine
          on the Atlantic shore when they were about to embark on some
          perilous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg

          of the last things Hannibal himself did before he marched on Italy
          was to repair to Gades and offer up to Melcarth prayers which were

          it would appear that at Gades, as at Tyre, though no image of
          Melcarth stood in the temple, an effigy of him was made up and
          burned at a yearly festival. For a certain Cleon of Magnesia
          related how, visiting Gades, he was obliged to sail away from the
          island with the rest of the multitude in obedience to the command
          of Hercules, that is, of Melcarth, and how on their return they
          found a monstrous man of the sea stranded on the beach and burning;
          for the god, they were told, had struck him with a
          thunderbolt.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href=

          may conjecture that at the annual festival of Melcarth strangers
          were obliged to quit the city, and that in their absence the
          mystery of burning the god was consummated. What Cleon and the rest
          saw on their return to Gades would, on this hypothesis, be the
          smouldering remains of a gigantic effigy of Melcarth in the
          likeness of a man riding on a sea-horse, just as he is represented

          in effigy seems to linger in the story that Dido or Elissa, the
          foundress and queen of the city, stabbed herself to death upon a

          two apparently contradictory views of her character as a queen and
          a goddess may be reconciled if we suppose that she was both the one
          and the other; that in fact the queen of Carthage in early days,
          like the queen of Egypt down to historical times, was regarded as
          divine, and had, like human deities elsewhere, to die a violent
          death either at the end of a fixed period or whenever her bodily
          and mental powers began to fail. In later ages the stern old custom
          might be softened down into a pretence by substituting an effigy
          for the queen or by allowing her to pass through the fire
          unscathed. A similar modification of the ancient rule appears to
          have been allowed at Tyre itself, the mother-city of Carthage. We
          have seen reason to think that the kings of Tyre, from whom Dido
          was descended, claimed to personate the god Melcarth, and that the
          deity was burned either in effigy or in the person of a man at an
          annual festival.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href=

          in the same chapter in which Ezekiel charges the king of Tyre with
          claiming to be a god, the prophet describes him as walking
          <span class="tei tei-q">“up and down amidst the stones of

          id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class=

          Tyre compounded for being burnt in the fire by walking up and down
          on hot stones, thereby saving his life at the expense perhaps of a
          few blisters on his feet. It is possible that when all went well
          with the commonwealth, children whom strict law doomed to the
          furnace of Moloch may also have been mercifully allowed to escape
          on condition of running the fiery gauntlet. At all events, a
          religious rite of this sort has been and is still practised in many
          parts of the world: the performers solemnly pace through a furnace
          of heated stones or glowing wood-ashes in the presence of a
          multitude of spectators. Examples of the custom have been adduced
          in another part of this work.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> Here
          I will cite only one. At Castabala, in Southern Cappadocia, there
          was worshipped an Asiatic goddess whom the Greeks called the
          Perasian Artemis. Her priestesses used to walk barefoot over a fire
          of charcoal without sustaining any injury. That this rite was a
          substitute for burning human beings alive or dead is suggested by
          the tradition which placed the adventure of Orestes and the Tauric
          Artemis at Castabala;<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=
          "#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> for
          the men or women sacrificed to the Tauric Artemis were first put to
          the sword and then burned in a pit of sacred fire.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> Among
          the Carthaginians another trace of such a practice may perhaps be
          detected in the story that at the desperate battle of Himera,
          fought from dawn of day till late in the evening, the Carthaginian
          king Hamilcar remained in the camp and kept sacrificing holocausts
          of victims on a huge pyre; but when he saw his army giving
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name=
          "Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> way before the
          Greeks, he flung himself into the flames and was burned to death.
          Afterwards his countrymen sacrificed to him and erected a great
          monument in his honour at Carthage, while lesser monuments were
          reared to his memory in all the Punic colonies.<a id="noteref_375"
          name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> In
          public emergencies which called for extraordinary measures a king
          of Carthage may well have felt bound in honour to sacrifice himself
          in the old way for the good of his country. That the Carthaginians
          regarded the death of Hamilcar as an act of heroism and not as a
          mere suicide of despair, is proved by the posthumous honours they
          paid him.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          evidence, taken altogether, raises a strong presumption, though it
          cannot be said to amount to a proof, that a practice of burning a
          deity, and especially Melcarth, in effigy or in the person of a
          human representative, was observed at an annual festival in Tyre
          and its colonies. We can thus understand how Hercules, in so far as
          he represented the Tyrian god, was believed to have perished by a
          voluntary death on a pyre. For on many a beach and headland of the
          Aegean, where the Phoenicians had their trading factories, the
          Greeks may have watched the bale-fires of Melcarth blazing in the
          darkness of night, and have learned with wonder that the strange
          foreign folk were burning their god. In this way the legend of the
          voyages of Hercules and his death in the flames may be supposed to
          have originated. Yet with the legend the Greeks borrowed the custom
          of burning the god; for at the festivals of Hercules a pyre used to
          be kindled in memory of the hero's fiery death on Mount Oeta.<a id=

            remarkable statue found at Amathus may represent Melcarth in the
            character of the lion-slayer, a character which the Greeks
            bestowed on Hercules. The statue in question is of colossal size,
            and exhibits a thick-set, muscular, hirsute deity of almost
            bestial aspect, with goggle eyes, huge ears, and a pair of stumpy
            horns on the top of his head. His beard is square and curly: his
            hair falls in three pigtails on his shoulders: his brawny arms
            appear to be tattooed. A lion's skin, clasped by a buckle, is
            knotted round his loins; and he holds the skin of a lioness in
            front of him, grasping a hind paw with each hand, while the head
            of the beast, which is missing, hung down between his legs. A
            fountain must have issued from the jaws of the lioness, for a
            rectangular hole, where the beast's head should be, communicates
            by a channel with another hole in the back of the statue. Greek
            artists working on this or a similar barbarous model produced the
            refined type of the Grecian Hercules with the lion's scalp thrown
            like a cowl over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
            118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            derived.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> but
            at all events the natives of the country, down to late times,
            worshipped a male deity who, in spite of a superficial
            assimilation to a fashionable Greek god, appears to have been an
            Oriental by birth and character. He had his principal seat at
            Tarsus, in a plain of luxuriant fertility and almost tropical
            climate, tempered by breezes from the snowy range of Tarsus on
            the north and from the sea on the south.<a id="noteref_383" name=

            Though Tarsus boasted of a school of Greek philosophy which at
            the beginning of our era surpassed those of Athens and
            Alexandria,<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=

            city apparently remained in manners and spirit essentially
            Oriental. The women went about the streets muffled up to the eyes
            in Eastern fashion, and Dio Chrysostom reproaches the natives
            with resembling the most dissolute of the Phoenicians rather than
            the Greeks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
            119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> On
            the coins of the city they assimilated their native deity to Zeus
            by representing him seated on a throne, the upper part of his
            body bare, the lower limbs draped in a flowing robe, while in one
            hand he holds a sceptre, which is topped sometimes with an eagle
            but often with a lotus flower. Yet his foreign nature is
            indicated both by his name and his attributes; for in Aramaic
            inscriptions on the coins he bears the name of the Baal of
            Tarsus, and in one hand he grasps an ear of corn and a bunch of
            grapes.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href=
            "#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a>
            These attributes clearly mark him out as a god of fertility in
            general, who conferred on his worshippers the two things which
            they prized above all other gifts of nature, the corn and the
            wine. He was probably therefore a Semitic, or at all events an
            Oriental, rather than a Greek deity. For while the Semite cast
            all his gods more or less in the same mould, and expected them
            all to render him nearly the same services, the Greek, with his
            keener intelligence and more pictorial imagination, invested his
            deities with individual characteristics, allotting to each of
            them his or her separate function in the divine economy of the
            world. Thus he assigned the production of the corn to Demeter,
            and that of the grapes to Dionysus; he was not so unreasonable as
            to demand both from the same hard-worked deity.</p>

            occupies five days; for the great barrier of the Taurus mountains
            rises like a wall between. The road runs through the famous pass
            of the Cilician Gates, and the scenery throughout is of the
            grandest Alpine character. On all sides the mountains tower
            skyward, their peaks sheeted in a dazzling pall of snow, their
            lower slopes veiled in the almost inky blackness of dense
            pine-forests, torn here and there by impassable ravines, or
            broken into prodigious precipices of red and grey rock which
            border the narrow valley for miles. The magnificence of the
            landscape is enhanced by the exhilarating influence of the brisk
            mountain air, all the more by contrast with the sultry heat of
            the plain of Tarsus which the traveller has left behind. When he
            emerges from the defile on the wide open tableland of Anatolia he
            feels that in a sense he has passed out of Asia, and that the
            highroad to Europe lies straight before him. The great mountains
            on which he now looks back formed for centuries the boundary
            between the Christian West and the Mohammedan East; on the
            southern side lay the domain of the Caliphs, on the northern side
            the Byzantine Empire. The Taurus was the dam that long repelled
            the tide of Arab invasion; and though year by year the waves
            broke through the pass of the Cilician Gates and carried havoc
            and devastation through the tableland, the refluent waters always
            retired to the lower level of the Cilician plains. A line of
            beacon lights stretching from the Taurus to Constantinople
            flashed to the Byzantine capital tidings of the approach of the
            Moslem invaders.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The village of
            Ibreez is charmingly situated at the northern foot of the Taurus,
            some six or seven miles south of the town of Eregli, the ancient
            Cybistra, From the town to the village the path goes through a
            richly cultivated district of wheat and vines along green lanes
            more lovely than those of Devonshire, lined by thick hedges and
            rows of willow, poplar, hazel, hawthorn, and huge old
            walnut-trees, where in early summer the nightingales warble on
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name=
            "Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> every side. Ibreez
            itself is embowered in the verdure of orchards, walnuts, and
            vines. It stands at the mouth of a deep ravine enclosed by great
            precipices of red rock. From the western of these precipices a
            river clear as crystal, but of a deep blue tint, bursts in a
            powerful jet, and being reinforced by a multitude of springs
            becomes at once a raging impassable torrent foaming and leaping
            with a roar of waters over the rocks in its bed. A little way
            from the source a branch of the main stream flows in a deep
            narrow channel along the foot of a reddish weather-stained rock
            which rises sheer from the water. On its face, which has been
            smoothed to receive them, are the sculptures. They consist of two
            colossal figures, representing a god adored by his worshipper.
            The deity, some fourteen feet high, is a bearded male figure,
            wearing on his head a high pointed cap adorned with several pairs
            of horns, and plainly clad in a short tunic, which does not reach
            his knees and is drawn in at the waist by a belt. His legs and
            arms are bare; the wrists are encircled by bangles or bracelets.
            His feet are shod in high boots with turned-up toes. In his right
            hand he holds a vine-branch laden with clusters of grapes, and in
            his raised left hand he grasps a bunch of bearded wheat, such as
            is still grown in Cappadocia; the ears of corn project above his
            fingers, while the long stalks hang down to his feet. In front of
            him stands the lesser figure, some eight feet high. He is clearly
            a priest or king, more probably perhaps both in one. His rich
            vestments contrast with the simple costume of the god. On his
            head he wears a round but not pointed cap, encircled by flat
            bands and ornamented in front with a rosette or bunch of jewels,
            such as is still worn by Eastern princes. He is draped from the
            neck to the ankles in a long robe heavily fringed at the bottom,
            over which is thrown a shawl or mantle secured at the breast by a
            clasp of precious stones. Both robe and shawl are elaborately
            carved with patterns in imitation of embroidery. A heavy necklace
            of rings or beads encircles the neck; a bracelet or bangle clasps
            the one wrist that is visible; the feet are shod in boots like
            those of the god. One or perhaps both hands are raised in the act
            of adoration. The large aquiline nose, like the beak of a hawk,
            is a conspicuous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg

            hair and beard of both are thick and curly.<a id="noteref_388"

            earth, and through it the life of animate creation. With its cool

            little way off, beyond the beneficent influence of the springs
            and streams, all is desolation—in summer an arid waste broken by
            great marshes and wide patches of salt, in winter a broad sheet
            of stagnant water, which as it dries up with the growing heat of
            the sun exhales a poisonous malaria. To the west, as far as the
            eye can see, stretches the endless expanse of the dreary
            Lycaonian plain, barren, treeless, and solitary, till it fades
            into the blue distance, or is bounded afar off by abrupt ranges
            of jagged volcanic mountains, on which in sunshiny weather the
            shadows of the clouds rest, purple and soft as velvet.<a id=

            wonder that the smiling luxuriance of the one landscape, sharply
            contrasting with the bleak sterility of the other, should have

            They are probably the horns of a bull; for to primitive
            cattle-breeders the bull is the most natural emblem of generative
            force. At Carchemish, the great Hittite capital on the Euphrates,
            a relief has been discovered which represents a god or a priest
            clad in a rich robe, and wearing on his head a tall horned cap
            surmounted by a disc.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href=

            Sculptures found at the palace of Euyuk in North-Western

            what was his name? and who were his worshippers? The Greeks
            apparently called him Hercules; at least in Byzantine times the
            neighbouring town of Cybistra adopted the name of Heraclea, which
            seems to show that Hercules was deemed the principal deity of the
            place.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href=

            the style and costume of the figures at Ibreez prove
            unquestionably that the god was an Oriental. If any confirmation
            of this view were needed, it is furnished by the inscriptions
            carved on the rock beside the sculptures, for these inscriptions
            are composed in the peculiar system of hieroglyphics now known as
            Hittite. It follows, therefore, that the deity worshipped at
            Tarsus and Ibreez was a god of the Hittites, that ancient and
            little-known people who occupied the centre of Asia Minor,
            invented a system of writing, and extended their influence, if
            not their dominion, at one time from the Euphrates to the Aegean.

            prolongation of the great plateau of Central Asia, with a climate

            that as it may, there are independent grounds for thinking that
            Sandan, Sandon, or Sandes may have been the name of the
            Cappadocian and Cilician god of fertility. For the god of Ibreez
            in Cappadocia appears, as we saw, to have been identified by the
            Greeks with Hercules, and we are told that a Cappadocian and
            Cilician name of Hercules was Sandan or Sandes.<a id=

            Hercules is said to have founded Tarsus, and the people of the
            city commemorated him at an annual or, at all events, periodical

            Apparently at this festival, as at the festival of Melcarth, the
            god was burned in effigy on his own pyre. For coins of Tarsus
            often exhibit the pyre as a conical structure resting on a
            garlanded altar or basis, with the figure of Sandan himself in
            the midst of it, while an eagle with spread wings perches on the
            top of the pyre, as if about to bear the soul of the burning god

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The type of
            Sandan or Hercules, as he is portrayed on the coins of Tarsus, is
            that of an Asiatic deity standing on a lion. It is thus that he
            is represented on the pyre, and it is thus that he appears as a
            separate figure without the pyre. From these representations we
            can form a fairly accurate conception of the form and attributes
            of the god. They exhibit him as a bearded man standing on a
            horned and often winged lion. Upon his head he wears a high
            pointed cap or mitre, and he is clad sometimes in a long robe,
            sometimes in a short tunic. On at least one coin his feet are
            shod in high boots with flaps. At his side or over his shoulder
            are slung a sword, a bow-case, and a quiver, sometimes only one
            or two of them. His right hand is raised and sometimes holds a
            flower. His left hand grasps a double-headed axe, and sometimes a
            wreath either in addition to the axe or instead of it; but the
            double-headed axe is one of Sandan's most constant
            attributes.<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href=

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now a deity of
            almost precisely the same type figures prominently in the
            celebrated group of Hittite sculptures which is carved on the
            rocks at Boghaz-Keui in North-Western Cappadocia. The village of
            Boghaz-Keui, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“the village of the
            defile,”</span> stands at the mouth of a deep, narrow, and
            picturesque gorge in a wild upland valley, shut in by rugged
            mountains of grey limestone. The houses are built on the lower
            slopes of the hills, and a stream issuing from the gorge flows
            past them to join the Halys, which is distant about ten hours'
            journey to the west. Immediately above the modern village a great
            ancient city, enclosed by massive fortification walls, rose on
            the rough broken ground of the mountainside, culminating in two
            citadels perched on the tops of precipitous crags. The walls are
            still standing in many places to a height of twelve feet or more.
            They are about fourteen feet thick and consist of an outer and
            inner facing built of large blocks with a core of rubble between
            them. On the outer side they are strengthened at intervals of
            about a hundred feet by projecting towers or buttresses, which
            seem designed rather as architectural supports than as military
            defences. The masonry, composed of large stones laid in roughly
            parallel courses, resembles in style that of the walls of
            Mycenae, with which it may be contemporary; and the celebrated
            Lion-gate at Mycenae has its counterpart in the southern gate of
            Boghaz-Keui, which is flanked by a pair of colossal stone lions
            executed in the best style of Hittite art. The eastern gate is
            adorned on its inner side with the figure of a Hittite warrior or
            Amazon carved in high relief. A dense undergrowth of stunted oak
            coppice now covers much of the site. The ruins of a large palace
            or temple, built of enormous blocks of stone, occupy a terrace in
            a commanding situation within the circuit of the walls. This vast
            city, some four or five miles in circumference, appears to have
            been the ancient Pteria, which Croesus, king of Lydia, captured
            in his war with Cyrus. It was probably the capital of a powerful
            Hittite empire before the Phrygians made their way from

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
            village of Boghaz-Keui a steep and rugged path leads up hill to a
            sanctuary, distant about a mile and a half to the east. Here
            among the grey limestone cliffs there is a spacious natural
            chamber or hall of roughly oblong shape, roofed only by the sky,
            and enclosed on three sides by high rocks. One of the short sides
            is open, and through it you look out on the broken slopes beyond
            and the more distant mountains, which make a graceful picture set
            in a massy frame. The length of the chamber is about a hundred
            feet; its breadth varies from twenty-five to fifty feet. A nearly
            level sward forms the floor. On the right-hand side, as you face
            inward, a narrow opening in the rock leads into another but much
            smaller chamber, or rather corridor, which would seem to have
            been the inner sanctuary or Holy of Holies. It is a romantic
            spot, where the deep shadows of the rocks are relieved by the
            bright foliage of walnut-trees and by the sight of the sky and
            clouds overhead. On the rock-walls of both chamber are carved the
            famous bas-reliefs. In the outer sanctuary these reliefs
            represent two great processions which defile along the two long
            sides of the chamber and meet face to face on the short wall at
            the inner end. The figures on the left-hand wall are for the most
            part men clad in the characteristic Hittite costume, which
            consists of a high pointed cap, shoes with turned-up toes, and a
            tunic drawn in at the waist and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> The
            figures on the right-hand wall are women wearing tall, square,
            flat-topped bonnets with ribbed sides; their long dresses fall in
            perpendicular folds to their feet, which are shod in shoes like
            those of the men. On the short wall, where the processions meet,
            the greater size of the central figures, as well as their
            postures and attributes, mark them out as divine. At the head of
            the male procession marches or is carried a bearded deity clad in
            the ordinary Hittite costume of tall pointed cap, short tunic,
            and turned-up shoes; but his feet rest on the bowed heads of two
            men, in his right hand he holds on his shoulder a mace or
            truncheon topped with a knob, while his extended left hand grasps
            a symbol, which apparently consists of a trident surmounted by an
            oval with a cross-bar. Behind him follows a similar, though
            somewhat smaller, figure of a man, or perhaps rather of a god,
            carrying a mace or truncheon over his shoulder in his right hand,
            while with his left he holds aloft a long sword with a flat hilt;
            his feet rest not on two men but on two flat-topped pinnacles,
            which perhaps represent mountains. At the head of the female
            procession and facing the great god who is borne on the two men,
            stands a goddess on a lioness or panther. Her costume does not
            differ from that of the women: her hair hangs down in a long
            plait behind: in her extended right hand she holds out an emblem
            to touch that of the god. The shape and meaning of her emblem are
            obscure. It consists of a stem with two pairs of protuberances,
            perhaps leaves or branches, one above the other, the whole being
            surmounted, like the emblem of the god, by an oval with a
            cross-bar. Under the outstretched arms of the two deities appear
            the front parts of two animals, which have been usually
            interpreted as bulls but are rather goats; each of them wears on
            its head the high conical Hittite cap, and its body is concealed
            by that of the deity. Immediately behind the goddess marches a
            smaller and apparently youthful male figure, standing like her
            upon a lioness or panther. He is beardless and wears the Hittite
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name=
            "Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dress of high
            pointed cap, short tunic, and shoes with turned-up toes. A
            crescent-hilted sword is girt at his side; in his left hand he
            holds a double-headed axe, and in his right a staff topped by an
            armless doll with the symbol of the cross-barred oval instead of
            a head. Behind him follow two women, or rather perhaps goddesses,
            resembling the goddess at the head of the procession, but with
            different emblems and standing not on a lioness but on a single
            two-headed eagle with outspread wings.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The entrance
            to the smaller chamber is guarded on either side by the figure of
            a winged monster carved on the rock; the bodies of both figures
            are human, but one of them has the head of a dog, the other the
            head of a lion. In the inner sanctuary, to which this
            monster-guarded passage leads, the walls are also carved in
            relief. On one side we see a procession of twelve men in Hittite
            costume marching with curved swords in their right hands. On the
            opposite wall is a colossal erect figure of a deity with a human
            head and a body curiously composed of four lions, two above and
            two below, the latter standing on their heads. The god wears the
            high conical Hittite hat: his face is youthful and beardless like
            that of the male figure standing on the lioness in the large
            chamber; and the ear turned to the spectator is pierced with a
            ring. From the knees downwards the legs, curiously enough, are
            replaced by a device which has been interpreted as the tapering
            point of a great dagger or dirk with a midrib. To the right of
            this deity a square panel cut in the face of the rock exhibits a
            group of two figures in relief. The larger of the two figures
            closely resembles the youth on the lioness in the outer
            sanctuary. His chin is beardless; he wears the same high pointed
            cap, the same short tunic, the same turned-up shoes, the same
            crescent-hilted sword, and he carries a similar armless doll in
            his right hand. But his left arm encircles the neck of the
            smaller figure, whom he seems to clasp to his side in an attitude
            of protection. The smaller figure thus embraced by the god is
            clearly a priest or priestly king. His face is beardless; he
            wears a skull-cap and a long mantle reaching to his feet with a
            sort of chasuble thrown over it. The crescent-shaped hilt of a
            sword projects from under his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> mantle. The wrist of his right arm is
            clasped by the god's left hand; in his left hand the priest holds
            a crook or pastoral staff which ends below in a curl. Both the
            priest and his protector are facing towards the lion-god. In an
            upper corner of the panel behind them is a divine emblem composed
            of a winged disc resting on what look like two Ionic columns,
            while between them appear three symbols of doubtful significance.
            The figure of the priest or king in this costume, though not in
            this attitude, is a familiar one; for it occurs twice in the
            outer sanctuary and is repeated twice at the great Hittite palace
            of Euyuk, distant about four and a half hours' ride to the
            north-east of Boghaz-Keui. In the outer sanctuary at Boghaz-Keui
            we see the priest marching in the procession of the men, and
            holding in one hand his curled staff, or <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">lituus</span></span>, and in the other a
            symbol like that of the goddess on the lioness: above his head
            appears the winged disc without the other attributes. Moreover he
            occupies a conspicuous place by himself on the right-hand wall of
            the outer sanctuary, quite apart from the two processions, and
            carved on a larger scale than any of the other figures in them.
            Here he stands on two heaps, perhaps intended to represent
            mountains, and he carries in his right hand the emblem of the
            winged disc supported on two Ionic columns with the other symbols
            between them, except that the central symbol is replaced by a
            masculine figure wearing a pointed cap and a long robe decorated
            with a dog-tooth pattern. On one of the reliefs at the palace of
            Euyuk we see the priest with his characteristic dress and staff
            followed by a priestess, each of them with a hand raised as if in
            adoration: they are approaching the image of a bull which stands
            on a high pedestal with an altar before it. Behind them a priest
            leads a flock of rams to the sacrifice. On another relief at
            Euyuk the priest, similarly attired and followed by a priestess,
            is approaching a seated goddess and apparently pouring a libation
            at her feet. Both these scenes doubtless represent acts of
            worship paid in the one case to a goddess, in the other to a
            bull.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have still
            to inquire into the meaning of the rock-carvings at Boghaz-Keui.
            What are these processions which are meeting? Who are the
            personages represented? and what are they doing? Some have
            thought that the scene is historical and commemorates a great
            event, such as a treaty of peace between two peoples or the
            marriage of a king's son to a king's daughter.<a id="noteref_410"

            134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            been rightly objected that the attributes of the principal
            figures prove them to be divine or priestly, and that the scene
            is therefore religious or mythical rather than historical. With
            regard to the two personages who head the processions and hold
            out their symbols to each other, the most probable opinion
            appears to be that they stand for the great Asiatic goddess of
            fertility and her consort, by whatever names these deities were
            known; for under diverse names a similar divine couple appears to
            have been worshipped with similar rites all over Western
            Asia.<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=

            bearded god who, grasping a trident in his extended left hand,
            heads the procession of male figures is probably the Father
            deity, the great Hittite god of the thundering sky, whose emblems
            were the thunderbolt and the bull; for the trident which he
            carries may reasonably be interpreted as a thunderbolt. The deity
            is represented in similar form on two stone monuments of Hittite
            art which were found at Zenjirli in Northern Syria and at Babylon
            respectively. On both we see a bearded male god wearing the usual
            Hittite costume of tall cap, short tunic, and shoes turned up at
            the toes: a crescent-hilted sword is girt at his side: his hands
            are raised: in the right he holds a single-headed axe or hammer,
            in the left a trident of wavy lines, which is thought to stand
            for forked lightning or a bundle of thunderbolts. On the
            Babylonian slab, which bears a long Hittite inscription, the
            god's cap is ornamented with a pair of horns.<a id="noteref_412"

            monument, found at Malatia on the Euphrates, there is carved a
            deity in the usual Hittite costume standing on a bull and
            grasping a trident or thunderbolt in his left hand, while facing
            him stands a priest clad in a long robe, holding a crook or
            curled staff in one hand and pouring a libation with the
            other.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> The
            Hittite thunder-god is also known to us from a treaty of alliance
            which about the year 1290 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> was contracted
            between Hattusil, King of the Hittites, and Rameses II., King of
            Egypt. By a singular piece of good fortune we possess copies of
            this treaty both in the Hittite and in the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id=
            "Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Egyptian language. The
            Hittite copy was found some years ago inscribed in cuneiform
            characters on a clay tablet at Boghaz-Keui; two copies of the
            treaty in the Egyptian language are engraved on the walls of
            temples at Thebes. From the Egyptian copies, which have been read
            and translated, we gather that the thunder-god was the principal
            deity of the Hittites, and that the two Hittite seals which were
            appended to the treaty exhibited the King embraced by the
            thunder-god and the Queen embraced by the sun-goddess of
            Arenna.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href=

            This Hittite divinity of the thundering sky appears to have long
            survived at Doliche in Commagene, for in later Roman art he
            reappears under the title of Jupiter Dolichenus, wearing a
            Phrygian cap, standing on a bull, and wielding a double axe in
            one hand and a thunderbolt in the other. In this form his worship
            was transported from his native Syrian home by soldiers and
            slaves, till it had spread over a large part of the Roman empire,
            especially on the frontiers, where it flourished in the camps of
            the legions.<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href=

            combination of the bull with the thunderbolt as emblems of the
            deity suggests that the animal may have been chosen to represent
            the sky-god for the sake not merely of its virility but of its
            voice; for in the peal of thunder primitive man may well have
            heard the bellowing of a celestial bull.</p><span class=

            the more remarkable because he is the only male who interrupts
            the long procession of women. Probably he is at once the divine
            son and the divine lover of the goddess; for we shall find later
            on that in Phrygian mythology Attis united in himself both these
            characters.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href=

            who is supported by a similar animal. It is natural that the

            take it as probable that the Oriental deities who are represented
            standing or sitting in human form on the backs of lions and other
            animals were originally indistinguishable from the beasts, and
            that the complete separation of the bestial from the human or
            divine shape was a consequence of that growth of knowledge and of
            power which led man in time to respect himself more and the
            brutes less. The hybrid gods of Egypt with their human
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name=
            "Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bodies and animal

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now
            perhaps hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of that strange
            colossal figure in the inner shrine at Boghaz-Keui with its human
            head and its body composed of lions. For it is to be observed
            that the head of the figure is youthful and beardless, and that
            it wears a tall pointed cap, thus resembling in both respects the
            youth with the double-headed axe who stands on a lion in the
            outer sanctuary. We may suppose that the leonine figure in the
            inner shrine sets forth the true mystic, that is, the old savage
            nature of the god who in the outer shrine presented himself to
            his worshippers in the decent semblance of a man. To the chosen
            few who were allowed to pass the monster-guarded portal into the
            Holy of Holies, the awful secret may have been revealed that
            their god was a lion, or rather a lion-man, a being in whom the
            bestial and human natures mysteriously co-existed.<a id=
            "noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> The
            reader may remember that on the rock beside this leonine divinity
            is carved a group which represents a god with his arm twined
            round the neck of his priest in an attitude of protection,
            holding one of the priest's hands in his own. Both figures are
            looking and stepping towards the lion-monster, and the god is
            holding out his right hand as if pointing to it. The scene may
            represent the deity revealing the mystery to the priest, or
            preparing him to act his part in some solemn rite for which all
            his strength and courage will be needed. He seems to be leading
            his minister onward, comforting him with an assurance that no
            harm can come near him while the divine arm is around him and the
            divine hand clasps his. Whither is he leading him? Perhaps to
            death. The deep shadows of the rocks which fall on the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name=
            "Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> two figures in the
            gloomy chasm may be an emblem of darker shadows soon to fall on
            the priest. Yet still he grasps his pastoral staff and goes
            forward, as though he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea, though
            I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
            evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff they comfort
            me.”</span></p>

            represent the divine Father, the divine Mother, and the divine
            Son. But we have still to ask, What are they doing? That they are
            engaged in the performance of some religious rite seems certain.
            But what is it? We may conjecture that it is the rite of the
            Sacred Marriage, and that the scene is copied from a ceremony
            which was periodically performed in this very place by human
            representatives of the deities.<a id="noteref_421" name=

            Indeed, the solemn meeting of the male and female figures at the
            head of their respective processions obviously suggests a
            marriage, and has been so interpreted by scholars, who, however,
            regarded it as the historical wedding of a prince and princess
            instead of the mystic union of a god and goddess, overlooking or
            explaining away the symbols of divinity which accompany the
            principal personages.<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a> We
            may suppose that at Boghaz-Keui, as at many other places in the
            interior of Asia Minor, the government was in the hands of a
            family who combined royal with priestly functions and personated
            the gods whose names they bore. Thus at Pessinus in Phrygia, as
            we shall see later on, the priests of Cybele bore the name of her
            consort Attis, and doubtless represented him in the ritual.<a id=
            "noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class=

            "Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> If this was so at
            Boghaz-Keui, we may surmise that the chief pontiff and his family
            annually celebrated the marriage of the divine powers of
            fertility, the Father God and the Mother Goddess, for the purpose
            of ensuring the fruitfulness of the earth and the multiplication
            of men and beasts. The principal parts in the ceremony would
            naturally be played by the pontiff himself and his wife, unless
            indeed they preferred for good reasons to delegate the onerous
            duty to others. That such a delegation took place is perhaps
            suggested by the appearance of the pontiff himself in a
            subordinate place in the procession, as well as by his separate
            representation in another place, as if he were in the act of
            surveying the ceremony from a distance.<a id="noteref_424" name=
            "noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a> The
            part of the divine Son at the rite would fitly devolve upon one
            of the high-priest's own offspring, who may well have been
            numerous. For it is probable that here, as elsewhere in Asia
            Minor, the Mother Goddess was personated by a crowd of sacred
            harlots,<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href=
            "#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a>
            with whom the spiritual ruler may have been required to consort
            in his character of incarnate deity. But if the personation of
            the Son of God at the rites laid a heavy burden of suffering on
            the shoulders of the actor, it is possible that the
            representative of the deity may have been drawn, perhaps by lot,
            from among the numerous progeny of the consecrated courtesans;
            for these women, as incarnations of the Mother Goddess, were
            probably supposed to transmit to their offspring some portion of
            their own divinity. Be that as it may, if the three principal
            personages in the processional scene at Boghaz-Keui are indeed
            the Father, the Mother, and the Son, the remarkable position
            assigned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg
            142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            to the third of them in the procession, where he walks behind his
            Mother alone in the procession of women, appears to indicate that
            he was supposed to be more closely akin to her than to his
            Father. From this again we may conjecturally infer that
            mother-kin rather than father-kin was the rule which regulated
            descent among the Hittites. The conjecture derives some support
            from Hittite archives, for the names of the Great Queen and the
            Queen Mother are mentioned along with that of the King in state
            documents.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href=

            other personages who figure in the procession may represent human
            beings masquerading in the costumes and with the attributes of
            deities. Such, for example, are the two female figures who stand
            on a double-headed eagle; the two male figures stepping on what
            seem to be two mountains; and the two winged beings in the
            procession of men, one of whom may be the Moon-god, for he wears
            a crescent on his head.<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427"

            be thought of these speculations, one thing seems fairly clear
            and certain. The figure which I have called the divine Son at
            Boghaz-Keui is identical with the god Sandan, who appears on the
            pyre at Tarsus. In both personages the costume, the attributes,
            the attitude are the same. Both represent a man clad in a short
            tunic with a tall pointed cap on his head, a sword at his side, a
            double-headed axe in his hand, and a lion or panther under his
            feet.<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href=
            "#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a>
            Accordingly, if we are right in identifying him as the divine Son
            at Boghaz-Keui, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
            143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            we may conjecture that under the name of Sandan he bore the same
            character at Tarsus. The conjecture squares perfectly with the
            title of Hercules, which the Greeks bestowed on Sandan; for
            Hercules was the son of Zeus, the great father-god. Moreover, we
            have seen that the Baal of Tarsus, with the grapes and the corn
            in his hand, was assimilated to Zeus.<a id="noteref_429" name=
            "noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a>
            Thus it would appear that at Tarsus as at Boghaz-Keui there was a
            pair of deities, a divine Father and a divine Son, whom the
            Greeks identified with Zeus and Hercules respectively. If the
            Baal of Tarsus was a god of fertility, as his attributes clearly
            imply, his identification with Zeus would be natural, since it
            was Zeus who, in the belief of the Greeks, sent the fertilizing
            rain from heaven.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href=
            "#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> And
            the identification of Sandan with Hercules would be equally
            natural, since the lion and the death on the pyre were features
            common to both. Our conclusion then is that it was the divine
            Son, the lion-god, who was burned in effigy or in the person of a
            human representative at Tarsus, and perhaps at Boghaz-Keui.
            Semitic parallels suggest that the victim who played the part of
            the Son of God in the fiery furnace ought in strictness to be the
            king's son.<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href=
            "#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> But
            no doubt in later times an effigy would be substituted for the
            man.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately
            we know next to nothing of the kings and priests of Tarsus. In
            Greek times we hear of an Epicurean philosopher of the city,
            Lysias by name, who was elected by his fellow-citizens to the
            office of Crown-wearer, that is, to the priesthood of Hercules.
            Once raised to that dignity, he would not lay it down again, but
            played the part of tyrant, wearing a white robe edged with
            purple, a costly cloak, white shoes, and a golden wreath of
            laurel. He truckled to the mob by distributing among them the
            property of the wealthy, while he put to death such as refused to
            open their money-bags to him.<a id="noteref_432" name=

            Though we cannot distinguish in this account <span class=

            "Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> between the legal and the
            illegal exercise of authority, yet we may safely infer that the
            priesthood of Hercules, that is of Sandan, at Tarsus continued
            down to late times to be an office of great dignity and power,
            not unworthy to be held in earlier times by the kings themselves.
            Scanty as is our information as to the kings of Cilicia, we hear
            of two whose names appear to indicate that they stood in some
            special relation to the divine Sandan. One of them was
            Sandu'arri, lord of Kundi and Sizu, which have been identified
            with Anchiale and Sis in Cilicia.<a id="noteref_433" name=
            "noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> The
            other was Sanda-sarme, who gave his daughter in marriage to
            Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria.<a id="noteref_434" name=

            would be in accordance with analogy if the kings of Tarsus
            formerly held the priesthood of Sandan and claimed to represent
            him in their own person.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We know that
            the whole of Western or Mountainous Cilicia was ruled by kings
            who combined the regal office with the priesthood of Zeus, or
            rather of a native deity whom, like the Baal of Tarsus, the
            Greeks assimilated to their own Zeus. These priestly potentates
            had their seat at Olba, and most of them bore the name either of
            Teucer or of Ajax,<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href=

            we may suspect that these appellations are merely Greek
            distortions of native Cilician names. Teucer (<span lang="el"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Teukros</span></span>) may be a corruption
            of Tark, Trok, Tarku, or Troko, all of which occur in the names
            of Cilician priests and kings. At all events, it is worthy of

            that in a long list of priests who served Zeus at the Corycian
            cave, not many miles from Olba, the names Tarkuaris, Tarkumbios,
            Tarkimos, Trokoarbasis, and Trokombigremis, besides many other

            well have been a native dynasty, who concocted a Greek pedigree
            for themselves in the days when Greek civilization was
            fashionable. The legend which attributed the foundation of the
            Cyprian Salamis to Teucer, son of Telamon, appears to be late and
            unknown to Homer.<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href=

            Moreover, a cruel form of human sacrifice which was practised in
            the city down to historical times savours rather of Oriental
            barbarity than of Greek humanity. Led or driven by the youths, a
            man ran thrice round the altar; then the priest stabbed him in
            the throat with a spear and burned his body whole on a heaped-up
            pyre. The sacrifice was offered in the month of Aphrodite to
            Diomede, who along with Agraulus, daughter of Cecrops, had a
            temple at Salamis. A temple of Athena stood within the same
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name=
            "Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sacred enclosure.
            It is said that in olden times the sacrifice was offered to
            Agraulus, and not to Diomede. According to another account it was
            instituted by Teucer in honour of Zeus. However that may have
            been, the barbarous custom lasted down to the reign of Hadrian,
            when Diphilus, king of Cyprus, abolished or rather mitigated it
            by substituting the sacrifice of an ox for that of a man.<a id=
            "noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> On
            the hypothesis here suggested we must suppose that these Greek
            names of divine or heroic figures at the Cyprian Salamis covered
            more or less similar figures of the Asiatic pantheon. And in the
            Salaminian burnt-sacrifice of a man we may perhaps detect the
            original form of the ceremony which in historical times appears
            to have been performed upon an image of Sandan or Hercules at
            Tarsus. When an ox was sacrificed instead of a man, the old
            sacrificial rites would naturally continue to be observed in all
            other respects exactly as before: the animal would be led thrice
            round the altar, stabbed with a spear, and burned on a pyre. Now
            at the Syrian Hierapolis the greatest festival of the year bore
            the name of the Pyre or the Torch. It was held at the beginning
            of spring. Great trees were then cut down and planted in the
            court of the temple: sheep, goats, birds, and other creatures
            were hung upon them: sacrificial victims were led round: then
            fire was set to the whole, and everything was consumed in the
            flames.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href=
            "#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a>
            Perhaps here also the burning of animals was a substitute for the
            burning of men. When the practice of human sacrifice becomes too
            revolting to humanity to be tolerated, its abolition is commonly
            effected by substituting <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> either animals or images for living men or
            women. At Salamis certainly, and perhaps at Hierapolis, the
            substitutes were animals: at Tarsus, if I am right, they were
            images. In this connexion the statement of a Greek writer as to
            the worship of Adonis in Cyprus deserves attention. He says that
            as Adonis had been honoured by Aphrodite, the Cyprians after his
            death cast live doves on a pyre to him, and that the birds,
            flying away from the flames, fell into another pyre and were
            consumed.<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href=
            "#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> The
            statement seems to be a description of an actual custom of
            burning doves in sacrifice to Adonis. Such a mode of honouring
            him would be very remarkable, since doves were commonly sacred to
            his divine mistress Aphrodite or Astarte. For example, at the
            Syrian Hierapolis, one of the chief seats of her worship, these
            birds were so holy that they might not even be touched. If a man
            inadvertently touched a dove, he was unclean or tabooed for the
            rest of the day. Hence the birds, never being molested, were so
            tame that they lived with the people in their houses, and
            commonly picked up their food fearlessly on the ground.<a id=

            the burning of the sacred bird of Aphrodite in the Cyprian
            worship of Adonis have been a substitute for the burning of a
            sacred man who personated the lover of the goddess?</p>

            lowlands of Eastern Cilicia, where winter is almost unknown and
            summer annually drives the population to seek in the cool air of
            the mountains a refuge from the intolerable heat and deadly
            fevers of the plains. In Western Cilicia, on the other hand, a
            lofty tableland, ending in a high sharp edge on the coast, rises
            steadily inland till it passes gradually into the chain of
            heights which divide it from the interior. Looked at from the sea

            its crest breaks into foam in the distant snows of the Taurus.
            The surface of the tableland is almost everywhere rocky and
            overgrown, in the intervals of the rocks, with dense, thorny,
            almost impenetrable scrub. Only here and there in a hollow or

            wandering herdsmen with their flocks now maintain a precarious
            existence in this rocky wilderness. Yet the ruined towns which
            stud the country prove that a dense population lived and throve
            here in antiquity, while numerous remains of wine-presses and
            wine-vats bear witness to the successful cultivation of the
            grape. The chief cause of the present desolation is lack of
            water; for wells are few and brackish, perennial streams hardly
            exist, and the ancient aqueducts, which once brought life and
            fertility to the land, have long been suffered to fall into
            disrepair.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But for ages
            together the ancient inhabitants of these uplands earned their
            bread by less reputable means than the toil of the husbandman and
            the vinedresser. They were buccaneers and slavers, scouring the
            high seas with their galleys and retiring with their booty to the
            inaccessible fastnesses of their mountains. In the decline of
            Greek power all over the East the pirate communities of Cilicia
            grew into a formidable state, recruited by gangs of desperadoes
            and broken men who flocked to it from all sides. The holds of
            these robbers may still be seen perched on the brink of the
            profound ravines which cleave the tableland at frequent
            intervals. With their walls of massive masonry, their towers and
            battlements, overhanging dizzy depths, they are admirably adapted
            to bid defiance to the pursuit of justice. In antiquity the dark
            forests of cedar, which clothed much of the country and supplied
            the pirates with timber for their ships, must have rendered
            access to these fastnesses still more difficult. The great gorge
            of the Lamas River, which eats its way like a sheet of forked
            lightning into the heart of the mountains, is dotted every few
            miles with fortified towns, some of them still magnificent in
            their ruins, dominating sheer cliffs high above the stream. They
            are now the haunt only of the ibex and the bear. Each of these
            communities had its own crest or badge, which may still be seen
            carved on the corners of the mouldering towers. No doubt, too, it
            blazoned the same crest on the hull, the sails, or the streamers
            of the galley which, manned with a crew of ruffians, it sent out
            to prey <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg

            and dangerous, indeed impassable. You may go for miles along the
            edge of these stupendous cliffs before you find a way down. The

            affords no foothold even to the agile nomads who alone roam these

            discovered in 1890 by Mr. J. Theodore Bent. But three years
            before another English traveller had caught a distant view of its
            battlements and towers outlined against the sky like a city of
            enchantment or dreams.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447"

            Standing at a height of nearly six thousand feet above the sea,
            the upper town commands a free, though somewhat uniform, prospect
            for immense distances in all directions. The sea is just visible
            far away to the south. On these heights the winter is long and
            severe. Snow lies on the ground for months. No Greek would have
            chosen such a site for a city, so bleak and chill, so far from
            blue water; but it served well for a fastness of brigands. Deep
            gorges, one of them filled for miles with tombs, surround it on
            all sides, rendering fortification walls superfluous. But a great
            square tower, four stories high, rises conspicuous on the hill,
            forming a landmark and earning for this upper town the native
            name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jebel Hissar</span></span>, or the Mountain
            of the Castle. A Greek inscription cut on the tower proves that
            it was built by Teucer, son of Tarkuaris, one of the priestly
            potentates of Olba. Among other remains of public buildings the
            most notable are forty tall Corinthian columns of the great
            temple of Olbian Zeus. Though coarse in style and corroded by
            long exposure to frost and snow, these massive pillars, towering
            above the ruins, produce an imposing effect. That the temple of
            which they formed part belonged indeed to Olbian Zeus is shown by
            a Greek inscription found within the sacred area, which records
            that the pent-houses on the inner side of the boundary wall were
            built by King Seleucus Nicator and repaired for Olbian Zeus by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the great high-priest Teucer, son of
            Zenophanes.”</span> About two hundred yards from this great
            temple are standing five elegant granite columns of a small
            temple dedicated to the goddess Fortune. Further, the remains of
            two theatres and many other public buildings attest the former
            splendour of this mountain city. An arched colonnade, of which
            some Corinthian columns are standing with their architraves, ran
            through the town; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg

            and an ancient paved road, lined with tombs and ruins, leads down
            hill to a lower and smaller city two or three miles distant. It
            is this lower town which retains the ancient name of Oura. Here
            the principal ruins occupy an isolated fir-clad height bounded by
            two narrow ravines full of rock-cut tombs. Below the town the
            ravines unite and form a fine gorge, down which the old road

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing yet
            found at Olba throws light on the nature of the god who was
            worshipped there under the Greek name of Zeus. But at two places
            near the coast, distant only some fourteen or fifteen miles from
            Olba, a deity also called Zeus by the Greeks was revered in
            natural surroundings of a remarkable kind, which must have stood
            in close relation with the worship, and are therefore fitted to
            illustrate it. In both places the features of the landscape are
            of the same general cast, and at one of them the god was
            definitely identified with the Zeus of Olba. The country here
            consists of a tableland of calcareous rock rent at intervals by
            those great chasms which are characteristic of a limestone
            formation. Similar fissures, with the accompaniment of streams or
            rivers which pour into them and vanish under ground, are frequent
            in Greece, and may be observed in our own country near
            Ingleborough in Yorkshire. Fossil bones of extinct animals are
            often found embedded in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
            153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the stalagmite or breccia of limestone caves. For example, the
            famous Kent's Hole near Torquay contained bones of the mammoth,
            rhinoceros, lion, hyaena, and bear; and red osseous breccias,
            charged with the bones of quadrupeds which have long disappeared
            from Europe, are common in almost all the countries bordering on
            the Mediterranean.<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href=
            "#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Western Cilicia is richer in Miocene deposits than any other part
            of Anatolia, and the limestone gorges of the coast near Olba are
            crowded with fossil oysters, corals, and other shells.<a id=

            Here, too, within the space of five miles the limestone plateau
            is rent by three great chasms, which Greek religion associated
            with Zeus and Typhon. One of these fissures is the celebrated
            Corycian cave.</p>

            legendary renown, you start from the dead Cilician city of
            Corycus on the sea, with its ruined walls, towers, and churches,
            its rock-hewn houses and cisterns, its shattered mole, its
            island-fortress, still imposing in decay. Viewed from the sea,
            this part of the Cilician coast, with its long succession of
            white ruins, relieved by the dark wooded hills behind, presents
            an appearance of populousness and splendour. But a nearer
            approach reveals the nakedness and desolation of the once
            prosperous land.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a>
            Following the shore westward from Corycus for about an hour you
            come to a pretty cove enclosed by wooded heights, where a spring
            of pure cold water bubbles up close to the sea, giving to the
            spot its name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tatlu-su</span></span>, or the Sweet Water.
            From this bay a steep ascent of about a mile along an ancient
            paved road leads inland to a plateau. Here, threading your way
            through a labyrinth or petrified sea of jagged calcareous rocks,
            you suddenly find yourself on the brink of a vast chasm which
            yawns at your feet. This is the Corycian cave. In reality it is
            not a cave but an immense hollow or trough in the plateau, of
            oval shape and perhaps half a mile in circumference. The cliffs
            which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
            154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            enclose it vary from one hundred to over two hundred feet in
            depth. Its uneven bottom slopes throughout its whole length from
            north to south, and is covered by a thick jungle of trees and
            shrubs—myrtles, pomegranates, carobs, and many more, kept always
            fresh and green by rivulets, underground water, and the shadow of
            the great cliffs. A single narrow path leads down into its
            depths. The way is long and rough, but the deeper you descend the
            denser grows the vegetation, and it is under the dappled shade of
            whispering leaves and with the purling of brooks in your ears
            that you at last reach the bottom. The saffron which of old grew
            here among the bushes is no longer to be found, though it still
            flourishes in the surrounding district. This luxuriant bottom,
            with its rich verdure, its refreshing moisture, its grateful
            shade, is called Paradise by the wandering herdsmen. They tether
            their camels and pasture their goats in it and come hither in the
            late summer to gather the ripe pomegranates. At the southern and
            deepest end of this great cliff-encircled hollow you come to the
            cavern proper. The ruins of a Byzantine church, which replaced a
            heathen temple, partly block the entrance. Inwards the cave
            descends with a gentle slope into the bowels of the earth. The
            old path paved with polygonal masonry still runs through it, but
            soon disappears under sand. At about two hundred feet from its
            mouth the cave comes to an end, and a tremendous roar of
            subterranean water is heard. By crawling on all fours you may
            reach a small pool arched by a dripping stalactite-hung roof, but
            the stream which makes the deafening din is invisible. It was
            otherwise in antiquity. A river of clear water burst from the
            rock, but only to vanish again into a chasm. Such changes in the
            course of streams are common in countries subject to earthquakes
            and to the disruption caused by volcanic agency. The ancients
            believed that this mysterious cavern was haunted ground. In the
            rumble and roar of the waters they seemed to hear the clash of
            cymbals touched by hands divine.<a id="noteref_452" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now,
            quitting the cavern, we return by the same path to the summit of
            the cliffs, we shall find on the plateau the ruins of a town and
            of a temple at the western edge of the great Corycian chasm. The
            wall of the holy precinct was built within a few feet of the
            precipices, and the sanctuary must have stood right over the
            actual cave and its subterranean waters. In later times the
            temple was converted into a Christian church. By pulling down a
            portion of the sacred edifice Mr. Bent had the good fortune to
            discover a Greek inscription containing a long list of names,
            probably those of the priests who superintended the worship. One
            name which meets us frequently in the list is Zas, and it is
            tempting to regard this as merely a dialectical form of Zeus. If
            that were so, the priests who bore the name might be supposed to
            personate the god.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href=

            many strange and barbarous-looking names, evidently foreign,
            occur in the list, and Zas may be one of them. However, it is
            certain that Zeus was worshipped at the Corycian cave; for about
            half a mile from it, on the summit of a hill, are the ruins of a
            larger temple, which an inscription proves to have been dedicated

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Zeus, or
            whatever native deity masqueraded under his name, did not reign
            alone in the deep dell. A more dreadful being haunted a still
            more awful abyss which opens in the ground only a hundred yards
            to the east of the great Corycian chasm. It is a circular
            cauldron, about a quarter <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=

            Corycian chasm in its general character, but smaller, deeper, and
            far more terrific in appearance. Its sides overhang and
            stalactites droop from them. There is no way down into it. The
            only mode of reaching the bottom, which is covered with
            vegetation, would be to be lowered at the end of a long rope. The
            nomads call this chasm Purgatory, to distinguish it from the
            other which they name Paradise. They say that there is a
            subterranean passage between the two, and that the smoke of a
            fire kindled in the Corycian cave may be seen curling out of the
            other. The one ancient writer who expressly mentions this second
            and more grisly cavern is Mela, who says that it was the lair of
            the giant Typhon, and that no animal let down into it could
            live.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href=

            Aeschylus puts into the mouth of Prometheus an account of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the earth-born Typhon, dweller in
            Cilician caves, dread monster, hundred-headed,”</span> who in his
            pride rose up against the gods, hissing destruction from his
            dreadful jaws, while from his Gorgon eyes the lightning flashed.
            But him a flaming levin bolt, crashing from heaven, smote to the
            very heart, and now he lies, shrivelled and scorched, under the
            weight of Etna by the narrow sea. Yet one day he will belch a
            fiery hail, a boiling angry flood, rivers of flame, to devastate
            the fat Sicilian fields.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a>
            This poetical description of the monster, confirmed by a similar
            passage of Pindar,<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href=
            "#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            clearly proves that Typhon was conceived as a personification of
            those active volcanoes which spout fire and smoke to heaven as if
            they would assail the celestial gods. The Corycian caverns are
            not volcanic, but the ancients apparently regarded them as such,
            else they would hardly have made them the den of Typhon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            one legend Typhon was a monster, half man and half brute,
            begotten in Cilicia by Tartarus upon the goddess Earth. The upper
            part of him was human, but from the loins downward he was an
            enormous snake. In the battle of the gods and giants, which was
            fought out in Egypt, Typhon hugged Zeus in his snaky coils,
            wrested <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
            157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            from him his crooked sword, and with the blade cut the sinews of
            the god's hands and feet. Then taking him on his back he conveyed
            the mutilated deity across the sea to Cilicia, and deposited him
            in the Corycian cave. Here, too, he hid the severed sinews, wrapt
            in a bear's skin. But Hermes and Aegipan contrived to steal the
            missing thews and restore them to their divine owner. Thus made
            whole and strong again, Zeus pelted his beaten adversary with
            thunderbolts, drove him from place to place, and at last
            overwhelmed him under Mount Etna. And the spots where the hissing
            bolts fell are still marked by jets of flame.<a id="noteref_458"

            that the discovery of fossil bones of large extinct animals may
            have helped to localize the story of the giant at the Corycian
            cave. Such bones, as we have seen, are often found in limestone
            caverns, and the limestone gorges of Cilicia are in fact rich in
            fossils. The Arcadians laid the scene of the battle of the gods
            and the giants in the plain of Megalopolis, where many bones of
            mammoths have come to light, and where, moreover, flames have
            been seen to burst from the earth and even to burn for
            years.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href=

            These natural conditions would easily suggest a fable of giants
            who had fought the gods and had been slain by thunderbolts; the
            smouldering earth or jets of flame would be regarded as the spots
            where the divine lightnings had struck the ground. Hence the
            Arcadians sacrificed to thunder and lightning.<a id="noteref_460"

            Sicily, too, great quantities of bones of mammoths, elephants,
            hippopotamuses, and other animals long extinct in the island have
            been found, and have been appealed to with confidence by
            patriotic Sicilians as conclusive evidence of the gigantic

            These remains of huge unwieldy creatures which once trampled
            through the jungle or splashed in the rivers of Sicily may have
            contributed with the fires of Etna to build up the story of
            giants imprisoned under the volcano and vomiting smoke and flame
            from its crater. <span class="tei tei-q">“Tales of <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About five
            miles to the north-east of the Corycian caverns, but divided from
            them by many deep gorges and impassable rocks, is another and
            very similar chasm. It may be reached in about an hour and a
            quarter from the sea by an ancient paved road, which ascends at
            first very steeply and then gently through bush-clad and wooded
            hills. Thus you come to a stretch of level ground covered with
            the well-preserved ruins of an ancient town. Remains of
            fortresses constructed of polygonal masonry, stately churches,
            and many houses, together with numerous tombs and reliefs, finely
            chiselled in the calcareous limestone of the neighbourhood, bear
            witness to the extent and importance of the place. Yet it is
            mentioned by no ancient writer. Inscriptions prove that its name
            was Kanyteldeis or Kanytelideis, which still survives in the
            modern form of Kanidiwan. The great chasm opens in the very heart
            of the city. So crowded are the ruins that you do not perceive
            the abyss till you are within a few yards of it. It is almost a
            complete circle, about a quarter of a mile wide, three-quarters
            of a mile in circumference, and uniformly two hundred feet or
            more in depth. The cliffs go sheer down and remind the traveller
            of the great quarries at Syracuse. But like the Corycian caves,
            the larger of which it closely resembles, the huge fissure is
            natural; and its bottom, like theirs, is overgrown with trees and
            vegetation. Two ways led down into it in antiquity, both cut
            through the rock. One of them was a tunnel, which is now
            obstructed; the other is still open. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Remains of columns and hewn stones in the
            bottom of the chasm seem to show that a temple once stood there.
            But there is no cave at the foot of the cliffs, and no stream
            flows in the deep hollow or can be heard to rumble underground. A
            ruined tower of polygonal masonry, which stands on the southern
            edge of the chasm, bears a Greek inscription stating that it was
            dedicated to Olbian Zeus by the priest Teucer, son of Tarkuaris.
            The letters are beautifully cut in the style of the third century
            before Christ. We may infer that at the time of the dedication
            the town belonged to the priestly kings of Olba, and that the
            great chasm was sacred to Olbian Zeus.<a id="noteref_463" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, then,
            was the character of the god who was worshipped under the name of
            Zeus at these two great natural chasms? The depth of the
            fissures, opening suddenly and as it were without warning in the
            midst of a plateau, was well fitted to impress and awe the
            spectator; and the sight of the rank evergreen vegetation at
            their bottom, fed by rivulets or underground water, must have
            presented a striking contrast to the grey, barren, rocky
            wilderness of the surrounding tableland. Such a spot must have
            seemed to simple folk a paradise, a garden of God, the abode of
            higher powers who caused the wilderness to blossom, if not with
            roses, at least with myrtles and pomegranates for man, and with
            grass and underwood for his flocks. So to the Semite, as we saw,
            the Baal of the land is he who fertilizes it by subterranean
            water rather than by rain from the sky, and who therefore dwells
            in the depths of earth rather than in the height of heaven.<a id=

            with the water-supply, and has therefore small excuse for levying
            a water-rate on his worshippers. Not, indeed, that Cilicia is
            rainless; but in countries bordering <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            unbroken through the long months of summer. Vegetation then
            withers: the face of nature is scorched and brown: most of the
            rivers dry up; and only their white stony beds, hot to the foot
            and dazzling to the eye, remain to tell where they flowed. It is
            at such seasons that a green hollow, a shady rock, a murmuring
            stream, are welcomed by the wanderer in the South with a joy and
            wonder which the untravelled Northerner can hardly imagine. Never
            do the broad slow rivers of England, with their winding reaches,
            their grassy banks, their grey willows mirrored with the soft
            English sky in the placid stream, appear so beautiful as when the
            traveller views them for the first time after leaving behind him
            the aridity, the heat, the blinding glare of the white southern
            landscape, set in seas and skies of caerulean blue.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may take
            it, then, as probable that the god of the Corycian and Olbian
            caverns was worshipped as a source of fertility. In antiquity,
            when the river, which now roars underground, still burst from the
            rock in the Corycian cave, the scene must have resembled Ibreez,
            where the god of the corn and the vine was adored at the source
            of the stream; and we may compare the vale of Adonis in the
            Lebanon, where the divinity who gave his name to the river was
            revered at its foaming cascades. The three landscapes had in
            common the elements of luxuriant vegetation and copious streams
            leaping full-born from the rock. We shall hardly err in supposing
            that these features shaped the conception of the deities who were
            supposed to haunt the favoured spots. At the Corycian cave the
            existence of a second chasm, of a frowning and awful aspect,
            might well suggest the presence of an evil being who lurked in it
            and sought to undo the beneficent work of the good god. Thus we
            should have a fable of a conflict between the two, a battle of
            Zeus and Typhon.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole
            we conclude that the Olbian Zeus, worshipped at one of these
            great limestone chasms, and clearly identical in nature with the
            Corycian Zeus, was also identical with the Baal of Tarsus, the
            god of the corn and the vine, who in his turn can hardly be
            separated from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
            161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the god of Ibreez. If my conjecture is right the native name of
            the Olbian Zeus was Tark or Trok, and the priestly Teucers of
            Olba represented him in their own persons. On that hypothesis the
            Olbian priests who bore the name of Ajax embodied another native
            deity of unknown name, perhaps the father or the son of Tark. A
            comparison of the coin-types of Tarsus with the Hittite monuments
            of Ibreez and Boghaz-Keui led us to the conclusion that the
            people of Tarsus worshipped at least two distinct gods, a father
            and a son, the father-god being known to the Semites as Baal and
            to the Greeks as Zeus, while the son was called Sandan by the
            natives, but Hercules by the Greeks. We may surmise that at Olba
            the names of Teucer and Ajax designated two gods who corresponded
            in type to the two gods of Tarsus; and if the lesser figure at
            Ibreez, who appears in an attitude of adoration before the deity
            of the corn and the vine, could be interpreted as the divine Son
            in presence of the divine Father, we should have in all three
            places the same pair of deities, represented probably in the

            evidence is far too slender to justify us in advancing this
            hypothesis as anything more than a bare conjecture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far, the
            Cilician deities discussed have been males; we have as yet found
            no trace of the great Mother Goddess who plays so important a
            part in the religion of Cappadocia and Phrygia, beyond the great
            dividing range of the Taurus. Yet we may suspect that she was not
            unknown in Cilicia, though her worship certainly seems to have
            been far less prominent there than in the centre of Asia Minor.
            The difference may perhaps be interpreted as evidence that
            mother-kin and hence the predominance of Mother Goddesses
            survived, in the bleak highlands of the interior, long after a
            genial climate and teeming soil had fostered the growth of a
            higher civilization, and with it the advance from female to male
            kinship, in the rich lowlands of Cilicia. Be that as it may,
            Cilician goddesses with or without a male partner are known to
            have been revered in various parts of the
            country.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg

                became the Fortune of the City.</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus at Tarsus
            itself the goddess 'Atheh was worshipped along with Baal; their
            effigies are engraved on the same coins of the city. She is
            represented wearing a veil and seated upon a lion, with her name
            in Aramaic letters engraved beside her.<a id="noteref_465" name=

            Hence it would seem that at Tarsus, as at Boghaz-Keui, the Father
            God mated with a lion-goddess like the Phrygian Cybele or the
            Syrian Atargatis. Now the name Atargatis is a Greek rendering of
            the Aramaic 'Athar-'atheh, a compound word which includes the
            name of the goddess of Tarsus.<a id="noteref_466" name=

            Thus in name as well as in attributes the female partner of the
            Baal of Tarsus appears to correspond to Atargatis, the Syrian
            Mother Goddess whose image, seated on a lion or lions, was
            worshipped with great pomp and splendour at Hierapolis-Bambyce
            near the Euphrates.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href=

            farther and find a correspondence between the Baal of Tarsus and
            the husband-god of Atargatis at Hierapolis-Bambyce? That
            husband-god, like the Baal of Tarsus, was identified by the
            Greeks with Zeus, and Lucian tells us that the resemblance of his
            image to the images of Zeus was in all respects unmistakable. But
            his image, unlike those of Zeus, was seated upon bulls.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> In
            point of fact he was probably Hadad, the chief male god of the
            Syrians, who appears to have been a god of thunder and fertility;
            for at Baalbec in the Lebanon, where the ruined temple of the Sun
            is the most imposing monument bequeathed to the modern world by
            Greek art in its decline, his image grasped in his left hand a
            thunderbolt and ears of corn,<a id="noteref_469" name=
            "noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> and
            a colossal statue of the deity, found near Zenjirli in Northern
            Syria, represents him with a bearded human head and horns, the
            emblem of strength and fertility.<a id="noteref_470" name=
            "noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> A
            similar god of thunder and lightning was worshipped from early
            times by the Babylonians and Assyrians; he bore the similar name
            of Adad and his emblems appear to have been a thunderbolt and a
            bull. On an Assyrian relief his image is represented as that of a
            bearded man clad in a short tunic, wearing a cap with two pairs
            of horns, and grasping an axe in his right hand and a thunderbolt
            in his left. His resemblance to the Hittite god of the thundering
            sky was therefore very close. An alternative name for this
            Babylonian and Assyrian deity was Ramman, an appropriate
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name=
            "Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> term, derived from

            we have seen that the god of Ibreez, whose attributes tally with
            those of the Baal of Tarsus, wears a cap adorned with bull's
            horns;<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href=
            "#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a>
            that the Father God at Boghaz-Keui, meeting the Mother Goddess on
            her lioness, is attended by an animal which according to the
            usual interpretation is a bull;<a id="noteref_473" name=
            "noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> and
            that the bull itself was worshipped, apparently as an emblem of
            fertility, at Euyuk near Boghaz-Keui.<a id="noteref_474" name=
            "noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class=

            Thus at Tarsus and Boghaz-Keui, as at Hierapolis-Bambyce, the
            Father God and the Mother Goddess would seem to have had as their
            sacred animals or emblems the bull and the lion respectively. In
            later times, under Greek influence, the goddess was apparently
            exchanged for, or converted into, the Fortune of the City, who
            appears on coins of Tarsus as a seated woman with veiled and
            turreted head, grasping ears of corn and a poppy in her hand. Her
            lion is gone, but a trace of him perhaps remains on a coin which
            exhibits the throne of the goddess adorned with a lion's
            leg.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href=
            "#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> In
            general it would seem that the goddess Fortune, who figures
            commonly as the guardian of cities in the Greek East, especially
            in Syria, was nothing but a disguised form of Gad, the Semitic
            god of fortune or luck, who, though the exigencies of grammar
            required him to be masculine, is supposed to have been often
            merely a special aspect of the great goddess Astarte or Atargatis
            conceived as the patroness and protector of towns.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a> In
            Oriental religion such permutations or combinations need not
            surprise us. To the gods all things are <span class="tei tei-pb"

            Alexander the Great sometimes disported himself in the costume of
            Artemis, while at other times he ransacked the divine wardrobe to
            figure in the garb of Hercules, of Hermes, and of Ammon.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> The
            change of the goddess 'Atheh of Tarsus into Gad or Fortune would
            be easy if we suppose that she was known as Gad-'Atheh,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Luck of 'Atheh,”</span> which occurs as
            a Semitic personal name.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479"

            the great Cilician plain near the mouth of the river

            coins exhibit two winged deities, a male and a female, in a
            kneeling or running attitude. On some of the coins the male deity
            is represented, like Janus, with two heads facing opposite ways,
            and with two pairs of wings, while beneath him is the forepart of
            a bull with a human head. The obverse of the coins which bear the
            female deity displays a conical stone, sometimes flanked by two
            bunches of grapes.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href=

            probably the emblem of a Mother Goddess, and the bunches of
            grapes indicate her fertilizing powers. The god with the two
            heads <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
            166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and four wings can hardly be any other than the Phoenician El,
            whom the Greeks called Cronus; for El was characterized by four
            eyes, two in front and two behind, and by three pairs of
            wings.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> A
            discrepancy in the number of wings can scarcely be deemed fatal
            to the identification. The god may easily have moulted some
            superfluous feathers on the road from Phoenicia to Mallus. On
            later coins of Mallus these quaint Oriental deities disappear,
            and are replaced by corresponding Greek deities, particularly by
            a head of Cronus on one side and a figure of Demeter, grasping
            ears of corn, on the other.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485"
            href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> The
            change doubtless sprang from a wish to assimilate the ancient
            native divinities to the new and fashionable divinities of the
            Greek pantheon. If Cronus and Demeter, the harvest god and
            goddess, were chosen to supplant El and his female consort, the
            ground of the choice must certainly have been a supposed
            resemblance between the two pairs of deities. We may assume,
            therefore, that the discarded couple, El and his wife, had also
            been worshipped by the husbandman as sources of fertility, the
            givers of corn and wine. One of these later coins of Mallus
            exhibits Dionysus sitting on a vine laden with ripe clusters,
            while on the obverse is seen a male figure guiding a yoke of oxen
            as if in the act of ploughing.<a id="noteref_486" name=
            "noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a>
            These types of the vine-god and the ploughman probably represent
            another attempt to adapt the native religion to changed
            conditions, to pour the old Asiatic wine into new Greek bottles.
            The barbarous monster with the multiplicity of heads and wings
            has been reduced to a perfectly human Dionysus. The sacred but
            deplorable old conical stone no longer flaunts proudly on the
            coins; it has retired to a decent obscurity in favour of a
            natural and graceful vine. It is thus that a truly progressive
            theology keeps pace with the march of intellect. But if these
            things were done by the apostles of culture at Mallus, we cannot
            suppose that the clergy of Tarsus, the capital, lagged behind
            their provincial <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg
            167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            brethren in their efforts to place the ancient faith upon a sound
            modern basis. The fruit of their labours seems to have been the
            more or less nominal substitution of Zeus, Fortune, and Hercules
            for Baal, 'Atheh, and Sandan.<a id="noteref_487" name=

            Another even more transparently Asiatic goddess was Perasia, or
            Artemis Perasia, who was worshipped at Hieropolis-Castabala in
            Eastern Cilicia. The extensive ruins of the ancient city, now
            known as Bodroum, cover the slope of a hill about three-quarters
            of a mile to the north of the river Pyramus. Above them towers
            the acropolis, built on the summit of dark grey precipices, and
            divided from the neighbouring mountain by a deep cutting in the
            rock. A mediaeval castle, built of hewn blocks of reddish-yellow
            limestone, has replaced the ancient citadel. The city possessed a
            large theatre, and was traversed by two handsome colonnades, of
            which some columns are still standing among the ruins. A thick
            growth of brushwood and grass now covers most of the site, and
            the place is wild and solitary. Only the wandering herdsmen
            encamp near the deserted city in winter and spring. The
            neighbourhood is treeless; yet in May magnificent fields of wheat
            and barley gladden the eye, and in the valleys the <span class=

            confessed by a puzzled worshipper, a physician named Lucius
            Minius Claudianus, who confided his doubts to the deity herself
            in some very indifferent Greek verses. He wisely left it to the
            goddess to say whether she was Artemis, or the Moon, or Hecate,
            or Aphrodite, or Demeter.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491"

            Further, we may reasonably conjecture that at the Cilician
            Castabala she was worshipped with rites like those which were
            held in honour of her namesake Artemis Perasia at another city of
            the same name, Castabala in Cappadocia. There, as we saw, the
            priestesses of the goddess walked over fire with bare feet
            unscathed.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href=
            "#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Probably the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg
            169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            same impressive ceremony was performed before a crowd of
            worshippers in the Cilician Castabala also. Whatever the exact
            meaning of the rite may have been, the goddess was in all
            probability one of those Asiatic Mother Goddesses to whom the
            Greeks often applied the name of Artemis.<a id="noteref_494"
            name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> The
            immunity enjoyed by the priestess in the furnace was attributed
            to her inspiration by the deity. In discussing the nature of
            inspiration or possession by a deity, the Syrian philosopher
            Jamblichus notes as one of its symptoms a total insensibility to
            pain. Many inspired persons, he tells us, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“are not burned by fire, the fire not taking hold of
            them by reason of the divine inspiration; and many, though they
            are burned, perceive it not, because at the time they do not live
            an animal life. They pierce themselves with skewers and feel
            nothing. They gash their backs with hatchets, they slash their
            arms with daggers, and know not what they do, because their acts
            are not those of mere men. For impassable places become passable
            to those who are filled with the spirit. They rush into fire,
            they pass through fire, they cross rivers, like the priestess at
            Castabala. These things prove that under the influence of
            inspiration men are beside themselves, that their senses, their
            will, their life are those neither of man nor of beast, but that
            they lead another and a diviner life instead, whereby they are
            inspired and wholly possessed.”</span><a id="noteref_495" name=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>
            Thus in traversing the fiery furnace the priestesses of Perasia
            were believed to be beside themselves, to be filled with the
            goddess, to be in a real sense incarnations of her
            divinity.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
            touchstone of inspiration is still applied by some villagers in
            the Himalayan districts of North-Western <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=

            local deity, who is represented by a trident and has his temples
            on lonely hills and desolate tracts. At his festival the people
            seat themselves in a circle about a bonfire. A kettle-drum is
            beaten, and one by one his worshippers become possessed by the
            god and leap with shouts round the flames. Some brand themselves
            with heated iron spoons and sit down in the fire. Such as escape
            unhurt are believed to be truly inspired, while those who burn
            themselves are despised as mere pretenders to the divine frenzy.
            Persons thus possessed by the spirit are called Airi's horses or
            his slaves. During the revels, which commonly last about ten
            days, they wear red scarves round their heads and receive alms
            from the faithful. These men deem themselves so holy that they
            will let nobody touch them, and they alone may touch the sacred
            trident, the emblem of their god.<a id="noteref_497" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
            then, we seem to be justified in concluding that under a thin
            veneer of Greek humanity the barbarous native gods of Cilicia
            continued long to survive, and that among them the great Asiatic
            goddess retained a place, though not the prominent place which
            she held in the highlands of the interior down at least to the
            beginning of our era. The principle that the inspired priest or
            priestess represents the deity in person appears, if I am right,
            to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name=
            "Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have been
            recognized at Castabala and at Olba, as well as at the sanctuary
            of Sarpedonian Artemis. There can be no intrinsic improbability,
            therefore, in the view that at Tarsus also the divine triad of
            Baal, 'Atheh, and Sandan may also have been personated by priests
            and priestesses, who, on the analogy of Olba and of the great
            sanctuaries in the interior of Asia Minor, would originally be at
            the same time kings and queens, princes and princesses. Further,
            the burning of Sandan in effigy at Tarsus would, on this
            hypothesis, answer to the walk of the priestess of Perasia
            through the furnace at Castabala. Both were perhaps mitigations
            of a custom of putting the priestly king or queen, or another
            member of the royal family, to death by fire.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory
            that kings or princes were formerly burned to death at Tarsus in
            the character of gods is singularly confirmed by another and
            wholly independent line of argument. For, according to one
            account, the city of Tarsus was founded not by Sandan but by
            Sardanapalus, the famous Assyrian monarch whose death on a great
            pyre was one of the most famous incidents in Oriental legend.
            Near the sea, within a day's march of Tarsus, might be seen in
            antiquity the ruins of a great ancient city named Anchiale, and
            outside its walls stood a monument called the monument of
            Sardanapalus, on which was carved in stone the figure of the
            monarch. He was represented snapping the fingers of his right
            hand, and the gesture was explained by an accompanying
            inscription, engraved in Assyrian characters, to the following
            effect:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sardanapalus, son of
            Anacyndaraxes, built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day. Eat, drink,
            and play, for everything else is not worth that,”</span> by which
            was implied that all other human affairs were not worth a snap of
            the fingers.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href=

            there is no reason to doubt the existence of such a monument,
            though we may conjecture that it was of Hittite rather than
            Assyrian origin; for, not to speak of the traces of Hittite art
            and religion which we have found at Tarsus, a group of Hittite
            monuments has been discovered at Marash, in the upper valley of
            the Pyramus.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href=

            Assyrians may have ruled over Cilicia for a time, but Hittite
            influence was probably much deeper and more lasting.<a id=

            there must have been some reason for his association with the
            city. On the present hypothesis that reason is to be found in the
            traditional manner of his death. To avoid falling into the hands
            of the rebels, who laid siege to Nineveh, he built a huge pyre in
            his palace, heaped it up with gold and silver and purple raiment,
            and then burnt himself, his wife, his concubines, and his eunuchs
            in the fire.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> The
            story is false of the historical Sardanapalus, that is, of the
            great Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, but it is true of his brother
            Shamashshumukin. Being appointed king of Babylon by Ashurbanipal,
            he revolted against his suzerain and benefactor, and was besieged
            by him in his capital. The siege was long and the resistance
            desperate, for the Babylonians knew that they had no mercy to
            expect from the ruthless Assyrians. But they were decimated by
            famine and pestilence, and when the city could hold out no more,
            King Shamashshumukin, determined not to fall alive into the hands
            of his offended brother, shut himself up in his <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id=
            "Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> palace, and there burned
            himself to death, along with his wives, his children, his slaves,
            and his treasures, at the very moment when the conquerors were
            breaking in the gates.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505"
            href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> Not
            many years afterwards the same tragedy was repeated at Nineveh
            itself by Saracus or Sinsharishkun, the last king of Assyria.
            Besieged by the rebel Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, and by
            Cyaxares, king of the Medes, he burned himself in his palace.
            That was the end of Nineveh and of the Assyrian empire.<a id=

            Thus Greek history preserved the memory of the catastrophe, but
            transferred it from the real victims to the far more famous
            Ashurbanipal, whose figure in after ages loomed vast and dim
            against the setting sun of Assyrian glory.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            Oriental monarch who prepared at least to die in the flames was
            Croesus, king of Lydia. Herodotus tells how the Persians under
            Cyrus captured Sardes, the Lydian capital, and took Croesus
            alive, and how Cyrus caused a great pyre to be erected, on which
            he placed the captive monarch in fetters, and with him twice
            seven Lydian youths. Fire was then applied to the pile, but at
            the last moment Cyrus relented, a sudden shower extinguished the
            flames, and Croesus was spared.<a id="noteref_507" name=

            it is most improbable that the Persians, with their profound
            reverence for the sanctity of fire, should have thought of
            defiling the sacred element with the worst of all pollutions, the
            contact of dead bodies.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508"

            Such an act would have seemed to them sacrilege of the deepest
            dye. For to them fire was the earthly form of the <span class=

            "Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> heavenly light, the eternal,
            the infinite, the divine; death, on the other hand, was in their
            opinion the main source of corruption and uncleanness. Hence they
            took the most stringent precautions to guard the purity of fire
            from the defilement of death.<a id="noteref_509" name=

            a man or a dog died in a house where the holy fire burned, the
            fire had to be removed from the house and kept away for nine
            nights in winter or a month in summer before it might be brought
            back; and if any man broke the rule by bringing back the fire
            within the appointed time, he might be punished with two hundred
            stripes.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

            for burning a corpse in the fire, it was the most heinous of all
            sins, an invention of Ahriman, the devil; there was no atonement
            for it, and it was punished with death.<a id="noteref_511" name=

            did the law remain a dead letter. Down to the beginning of our
            era the death penalty was inflicted on all who threw a corpse or

            conceivable.</p>

            been preserved by two older witnesses—namely, by the Greek poet
            Bacchylides, who was born some forty years after the event,<a id=

            by a Greek artist who painted the scene on a red-figured vase
            about, or soon after, the time of the poet's birth. Bacchylides
            tells us that when the Persians captured Sardes, Croesus, unable
            to brook the thought of slavery, caused a pyre to be erected in
            front of his courtyard, mounted it with his wife and daughters,
            and bade a page apply a light to the wood. A bright blaze shot
            up, but Zeus extinguished it with rain from heaven, and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name=
            "Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Apollo of the

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a> In
            like manner the vase-painter clearly represents the burning of
            Croesus as a voluntary act, not as a punishment inflicted on him
            by the conqueror. He lets us see the king enthroned upon the pyre
            with a wreath of laurel on his head and a sceptre in one hand,
            while with the other he is pouring a libation. An attendant is in
            the act of applying to the pile two objects which have been
            variously interpreted as torches to kindle the wood or whisks to
            sprinkle holy water. The demeanour of the king is solemn and
            composed: he seems to be performing a religious rite, not
            suffering an ignominious death.<a id="noteref_515" name=

            that in the extremity of his fortunes Croesus prepared to meet
            death like a king or a god in the flames. It was thus that

            it was thus that the last king of Assyria expired in the ruins of
            his capital; and it was thus that, sixty-six years after the

            Dido with each other and with the historical cases of the burning

            time when queens as well as kings were expected under certain
            circumstances, perhaps on the death of their consort, to perish
            in the fire. The conclusion can hardly be deemed extravagant when

            it can hardly be accidental that the place assigned by Isaiah to
            the king's pyre is the very spot in the Valley of Hinnom where
            the first-born children were actually burned by their parents in
            honour of Moloch <span class="tei tei-q">“the King.”</span> The
            exact site of the Valley of Hinnom is disputed, but all are
            agreed in identifying it with one of the ravines which encircle
            or intersect Jerusalem; and according to some eminent authorities
            it was the one called by Josephus the Tyropoeon.<a id=

            shawls, scarfs, handkerchiefs, books, and the like. These are
            placed in two stone basins on the top of two low pillars, and
            being drenched with oil and ignited they are consumed to ashes
            amid the loud applause, shouts, and cries of the spectators. A

            being allowed to open the ceremony by burning a costly shawl. On

            This curious ceremony may be explained by the widespread practice
            of burning property for the use and benefit of the dead. So, to
            take a single instance, the tyrant Periander collected the finest
            raiment of all the women in Corinth and burned it in a pit for
            his dead wife, who had sent him word by necromancy that she was
            cold and naked in the other world, because the clothes he buried
            with her had not been burnt.<a id="noteref_528" name=

            like manner, perhaps, garments and other valuables may have been
            consumed on the pyre for the use of the dead kings of Judah. In
            Siam, the corpse of a king or queen is burned in a huge structure
            resembling a permanent palace, which with its many-gabled and
            high-pitched roofs and multitudinous tinselled spires, soaring to
            a height of over two hundred feet, sometimes occupies an area of

            and these traditions seem to prove that under certain
            circumstances Oriental monarchs deliberately chose to burn
            themselves to death. What were these circumstances? and what were
            the consequences of the act? If the intention had merely been to
            escape from the hands of a conqueror, an easier mode of death
            would naturally have been chosen. There must have been a special
            reason for electing to die by fire. The legendary death of
            Hercules, the historical death of Hamilcar, and the picture of
            Croesus enthroned in state on the pyre and pouring a libation,
            all combine to indicate that to be burnt alive was regarded as a
            solemn sacrifice, nay, more than that, as an apotheosis which
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name=
            "Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> raised the victim

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> For
            it is to be remembered that Hamilcar as well as Hercules was
            worshipped after death. Fire, moreover, was regarded by the
            ancients as a purgative so powerful that properly applied it
            could burn away all that was mortal of a man, leaving only the
            divine and immortal spirit behind. Hence we read of goddesses who
            essayed to confer immortality on the infant sons of kings by
            burning them in the fire by night; but their beneficent purpose
            was always frustrated by the ignorant interposition of the mother
            or father, who peeping into the room saw the child in the flames
            and raised a cry of horror, thus disconcerting the goddess at her
            magic rites. This story is told of Isis in the house of the king
            of Byblus, of Demeter in the house of the king of Eleusis, and of
            Thetis in the house of her mortal husband Peleus.<a id=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire,”</span> says Jamblichus,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“destroys the material part of
            sacrifices, it purifies all things that are brought near it,
            releasing them from the bonds of matter and, in virtue of the
            purity of its nature, making them meet for communion with the
            gods. So, too, it releases us from the bondage of corruption, it
            likens us to the gods, it makes us meet for their friendship, and
            it converts our material nature into an immaterial.”</span><a id=

            Thus we can understand why kings and commoners who claimed or
            aspired to divinity should choose death by fire. It opened to
            them the gates of heaven. The quack Peregrinus, who ended his
            disreputable career in the flames at Olympia, gave out that after
            death he would be turned into a spirit who would guard men from
            the perils of the night; and, as Lucian remarked, no doubt there
            were plenty of fools to believe him.<a id="noteref_535" name=

            According to one account, the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles,
            who set up for being a god in his lifetime, leaped into the
            crater of Etna in order to establish his claim to godhead.<a id=

            There is nothing incredible in the tradition. The crack-brained
            philosopher, with his itch for notoriety, may well have done what

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But apart from
            any general notions of the purificatory virtues of fire, the
            kings of Lydia seem to have had a special reason for regarding
            death in the flames as their appropriate end. For the ancient
            dynasty of the Heraclids which preceded the house of Croesus on
            the throne traced their descent from a god or hero whom the
            Greeks called Hercules;<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539"
            href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> and
            this Lydian Hercules appears to have been identical in name and
            in substance with the Cilician Hercules, whose effigy was
            regularly burned on a great pyre at Tarsus. The Lydian Hercules
            bore the name of Sandon;<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540"
            href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> the
            Cilician Hercules bore the name of Sandan, or perhaps rather of
            Sandon, since Sandon is known from inscriptions and other
            evidence to have been a Cilician name.<a id="noteref_541" name=
            "noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> The
            characteristic emblems of the Cilician Hercules were the lion and
            the double-headed axe; and both these emblems meet us at Sardes
            in connexion with the dynasty of the Heraclids. For the
            double-headed axe was carried as part of the sacred regalia by
            Lydian kings from the time of the legendary queen Omphale down to
            the reign of Candaules, the last of the Heraclid kings. It is
            said to have been given to Omphale by Hercules himself, and it
            was apparently regarded as a palladium of the Heraclid
            sovereignty; for after the dotard Candaules ceased to carry the
            axe himself, and had handed it over to the keeping of a courtier,
            a rebellion broke out, and the ancient dynasty of the Heraclids
            came to an end. The new king Gyges did not attempt to carry the
            old emblem of sovereignty; he dedicated it with other spoils to
            Zeus in Caria. Hence the image of the Carian Zeus bore an axe in
            his hand and received the epithet of Labrandeus, from
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">labrys</span></span>, the Lydian word for

            Such is Plutarch's account; but we may <span class="tei tei-pb"

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> suspect that Zeus, or rather the native god
            whom the Greeks identified with Zeus, carried the axe long before
            the time of Candaules. If, as is commonly supposed, the axe was
            the symbol of the Asiatic thunder-god,<a id="noteref_543" name=
            "noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> it
            would be an appropriate emblem in the hand of kings, who are so
            often expected to make rain, thunder, and lightning for the good
            of their people. Whether the kings of Lydia were bound to make
            thunder and rain we do not know; but at all events, like many
            early monarchs, they seem to have been held responsible for the
            weather and the crops. In the reign of Meles the country suffered
            severely from dearth, so the people consulted an oracle, and the
            deity laid the blame on the kings, one of whom had in former
            years incurred the guilt of murder. The soothsayers accordingly
            declared that King Meles, though his own hands were clean, must
            be banished for three years in order that the taint of bloodshed
            should be purged away. The king obeyed and retired to Babylon,
            where he lived three years. In his absence the kingdom was
            administered by a deputy, a certain Sadyattes, son of Cadys, who
            traced his descent from Tylon.<a id="noteref_544" name=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> As
            to this Tylon we shall hear more presently. Again, we read that
            the Lydians rejoiced greatly at the assassination of Spermus,
            another of their kings, <span class="tei tei-q">“for he was very
            wicked, and the land suffered from drought in his
            reign.”</span><a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href=

            Apparently, like the ancient Irish and many modern Africans, they
            laid the drought at the king's door, and thought that he only got
            what he deserved under the knife of the assassin.</p><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
            the lion, the other emblem of the Cilician Hercules, we are told
            that the same king Meles, who was banished because of a dearth,
            sought to make the acropolis of Sardes impregnable by carrying
            round it a lion which a concubine had borne to him. Unfortunately
            at a single point, where the precipices were such that it seemed
            as if no human foot could scale them, he omitted to carry the
            beast, and sure enough at that very point the Persians afterwards
            clambered up into the citadel.<a id="noteref_546" name=

            boasted their descent from the lion-hero Hercules; hence the
            carrying of a lion round the acropolis was probably a form of
            consecration intended to place the stronghold under the
            guardianship of the lion-god, the hereditary deity of the royal
            family. And the story that the king's concubine gave birth to a
            lion's whelp suggests that the Lydian kings not only claimed
            kinship with the beast, but posed as lions in their own persons
            and passed off their sons as lion-cubs. Croesus dedicated at
            Delphi a lion of pure gold, perhaps as a badge of Lydia,<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
            death, or the attempted death, of Croesus on the pyre completes
            the analogy between the Cilician and the Lydian Hercules. At
            Tarsus and at Sardes we find the worship of a god whose symbols
            were the lion and the double-headed axe, and who was burned on a
            great pyre, either in effigy or in the person of a human
            representative. The Greeks called him Hercules, but his native
            name was Sandan or Sandon. At Sardes he seems to have been
            personated by the kings, who carried the double-axe and perhaps
            wore, like their ancestor Hercules, the lion's skin. We may
            conjecture that at Tarsus also the royal family aped the
            lion-god. At all events we know that Sandan, the name of the god,
            entered into the names of Cilician <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we have

            Sandon-Hercules of Lydia was also a Hittite god, and that the
            Heraclid dynasty of Lydia were of Hittite blood. Certainly the
            influence, if not the rule, of the Hittites extended to Lydia;
            for at least two rock-carvings accompanied by Hittite
            inscriptions are still to be seen in the country. Both of them
            attracted the attention of the ancient Greeks. One of them
            represents a god or warrior in Hittite costume armed with a spear
            and bow. It is carved on the face of a grey rock, which stands
            out conspicuous on a bushy hillside, where an old road runs
            through a glen from the valley of the Hermus to the valley of the
            Cayster. The place is now called Kara-Bel. Herodotus thought that
            the figure represented the Egyptian king and conqueror
            Sesostris.<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href=
            "#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> The
            other monument is a colossal seated figure of the Mother of the
            Gods, locally known in antiquity as Mother Plastene. It is hewn
            out of the solid rock and occupies a large niche in the face of a
            cliff at the steep northern foot of Mount Sipylus.<a id=

            Thus it would seem that at some time or other the Hittites
            carried their arms to the shores of the Aegean. There is no
            improbability, therefore, in the view that a Hittite dynasty may
            have reigned at Sardes.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553"

            probably followed by a ceremony of his resurrection or awakening,
            to indicate that the divine life was not extinct, but had only
            assumed a fresher and purer form. Of that resurrection we have,
            so far as I am aware, no direct evidence. In default of it,
            however, there is a tale of a local Lydian hero called Tylon or
            Tylus, who was killed and brought to life again. The story runs
            thus. Tylon or Tylus was a son of Earth.<a id="noteref_555" name=

            day as he was walking on the banks of the Hermus a serpent stung
            and killed him. His distressed sister Moire had recourse to a

            serpent's mate culled a herb, <span class="tei tei-q">“the flower
            of Zeus”</span> in the woods, and bringing it in her mouth put it
            to the lips of the dead serpent, which immediately revived. In
            her turn Moire took the hint and restored her brother Tylon to

            Tylon seems to have been more than a mere hero of fairy-tales. He
            was closely associated with Sardes, for he figures on the coins

            probably in one of the vernal months, and the revival of the hero
            and of the goddess may well have been represented together. The
            Golden Flower of the Festival would then be the <span class=

            yellow crocus of nature or rather her more gorgeous sister, the

            it is an elegant conjecture, if it is nothing more, that the very

                have been intended to recruit his divine energies.</span>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it
            appears that a custom of burning a god in effigy or in the person
            of a human representative was practised by at least two peoples
            of Western Asia, the Phoenicians and the Hittites. Whether they
            both developed the custom independently, or whether one of them
            adopted it from the other, we cannot say. And their reasons for
            celebrating a rite which to us seems strange and monstrous are
            also obscure. In the preceding inquiry some grounds have been
            adduced for thinking that the practice was based on a conception
            of the purifying virtue of fire, which, by destroying the
            corruptible and perishable elements of man, was supposed to fit
            him for union with the imperishable and the divine. Now to people
            who created their gods in their own likeness, and imagined them
            subject to the same law of decadence and death, the idea would
            naturally occur that fire might do for the gods what it was
            believed to do for men, that it could purge them of the taint of
            corruption and decay, could sift the mortal from the immortal in
            their composition, and so endow them with eternal youth. Hence a
            custom might arise of subjecting the deities themselves, or the
            more important of them, to an ordeal of fire for the purpose of
            refreshing and renovating those creative energies on the
            maintenance of which so much depended. To the coarse apprehension
            of the uninstructed and unsympathetic observer the solemn rite
            might easily wear a very different aspect. According as he was of
            a pious or of a sceptical turn of mind, he might <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id=
            "Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> denounce it as a sacrilege or
            deride it as an absurdity. <span class="tei tei-q">“To burn the
            god whom you worship,”</span> he might say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“is the height of impiety and of folly. If you
            succeed in the attempt, you kill him and deprive yourselves of
            his valuable services. If you fail, you have mortally offended
            him, and sooner or later he will visit you with his severe
            displeasure.”</span> To this the worshipper, if he was patient
            and polite, might listen with a smile of indulgent pity for the
            ignorance and obtuseness of the critic. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“You are much mistaken,”</span> he might observe,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“in imagining that we expect or attempt
            to kill the god whom we adore. The idea of such a thing is as
            repugnant to us as to you. Our intention is precisely the
            opposite of that which you attribute to us. Far from wishing to
            destroy the deity, we desire to make him live for ever, to place
            him beyond the reach of that process of degeneration and final
            dissolution to which all things here below appear by their nature
            to be subject. He does not die in the fire. Oh no! Only the
            corruptible and mortal part of him perishes in the flames: all
            that is incorruptible and immortal of him will survive the purer
            and stronger for being freed from the contagion of baser
            elements. That little heap of ashes which you see there is not
            our god. It is only the skin which he has sloughed, the husk
            which he has cast. He himself is far away, in the clouds of
            heaven, in the depths of earth, in the running waters, in the
            tree and the flower, in the corn and the vine. We do not see him
            face to face, but every year he manifests his divine life afresh
            in the blossoms of spring and the fruits of autumn. We eat of his
            broken body in bread. We drink of his shed blood in the juice of
            the grape.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some such
            train of reasoning may suffice to explain, though naturally not
            to justify, the custom which we bluntly call the burning of a
            god. Yet it is worth while to ask whether in the development of
            the practice these general considerations may not have been
            reinforced or modified by special circumstances; for example, by
            the natural features of the country where the custom grew up. For
            the history <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
            190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of religion, like that of all other human institutions, has been
            profoundly affected by local conditions, and cannot be fully
            understood apart from them. Now Asia Minor, the region where the
            practice in question appears to have been widely diffused, has
            from time immemorial been subjected to the action of volcanic
            forces on a great scale. It is true that, so far as the memory of
            man goes back, the craters of its volcanoes have been extinct,
            but the vestiges of their dead or slumbering fires are to be seen
            in many places, and the country has been shaken and rent at
            intervals by tremendous earthquakes. These phenomena cannot fail
            to have impressed the imagination of the inhabitants, and thereby
            to have left some mark on their religion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
            extinct volcanoes of Anatolia the greatest is Mount Argaeus, in
            the centre of Cappadocia, the heart of the old Hittite country.
            It is indeed the highest point of Asia Minor, and one of the
            loftiest mountains known to the ancients; for in height it falls
            not very far short of Mount Blanc. Towering abruptly in a huge
            pyramid from the plain, it is a conspicuous object for miles on
            miles. Its top is white with eternal snow, and in antiquity its
            lower slopes were clothed with dense forests, from which the
            inhabitants of the treeless Cappadocian plains drew their supply
            of timber. In these woods, and in the low grounds at the foot of
            the mountain, the languishing fires of the volcano manifested
            themselves as late as the beginning of our era. The ground was
            treacherous. Under a grassy surface there lurked pits of fire,
            into which stray cattle and unwary travellers often fell.
            Experienced woodmen used great caution when they went to fell
            trees in the forest. Elsewhere the soil was marshy, and flames
            were seen to play over it at night.<a id="noteref_565" name=

            but what shape they took we cannot say. Nor do we know whether
            sacrifices were offered on the top of the mountain, though a
            curious discovery may perhaps be thought to indicate that they
            were. Sharp and lofty pinnacles of red porphyry, inaccessible to
            the climber, rise in imposing grandeur from the eternal snow of
            the summit, and here Mr. Tozer found that the rock had been
            perforated in various places with human habitations. One such
            rock-hewn dwelling winds inward for a considerable distance; rude

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the
            Persian rule Cappadocia became, and long continued to be, a great
            seat of the Zoroastrian fire-worship. In the time of Strabo,
            about the beginning of our era, the votaries of that faith and
            their temples were still numerous in the country. The perpetual
            fire burned on an altar, surrounded by a heap of ashes, in the
            middle of the temple; and the priests daily chanted their liturgy
            before it, holding in their hands a bundle of myrtle rods and
            wearing on their heads tall felt caps with cheek-pieces which
            covered their lips, lest they should defile the sacred flame with
            their breath.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href=
            "#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> It
            is reasonable to suppose that the natural fires which burned
            perpetually on the outskirts of Mount Argaeus attracted the
            devotion of the disciples of Zoroaster, for elsewhere similar
            fires have been the object of religious <span class="tei tei-pb"

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> reverence down to modern times. Thus at
            Jualamukhi, on the lower slopes of the Himalayas, jets of
            combustible gas issue from the earth; and a great Hindoo temple,
            the resort of many pilgrims, is built over them. The perpetual
            flame, which is of a reddish hue and emits an aromatic perfume,
            rises from a pit in the fore-court of the sanctuary. The
            worshippers deliver their gifts, consisting usually of flowers,
            to the attendant fakirs, who first hold them over the flame and
            then cast them into the body of the temple.<a id="noteref_568"
            name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>
            Again, Hindoo pilgrims make their way with great difficulty to
            Baku on the Caspian, in order to worship the everlasting fires
            which there issue from the beds of petroleum. The sacred spot is
            about ten miles to the north-east of the city. An English
            traveller, who visited Baku in the middle of the eighteenth
            century, has thus described the place and the worship.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There are several ancient temples built
            with stone, supposed to have been all dedicated to fire; most of
            them are arched vaults, not above ten to fifteen feet high.
            Amongst others there is a little temple, in which the Indians now
            worship; near the altar, about three feet high, is a large hollow
            cane, from the end of which issues a blue flame, in colour and
            gentleness not unlike a lamp that burns with spirits, but
            seemingly more pure. These Indians affirm that this flame has
            continued ever since the flood, and they believe it will last to
            the end of the world; that if it was resisted or suppressed in
            that place, it would rise in some other. Here are generally forty
            or fifty of these poor devotees, who come on a pilgrimage from
            their own country, and subsist upon wild sallary, and a kind of
            Jerusalem artichoke, which are very good food, with other herbs
            and roots, found a little to the northward. Their business is to
            make expiation, not for their own sins only, but for those of
            others; and they continue the longer time, in proportion to the
            number of persons for whom they have engaged to pray. They mark
            their foreheads with saffron, and have a great veneration for a
            red cow.”</span><a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            volcanic region of Asia Minor is the district of Lydia, to which,
            on account of its remarkable appearance, the Greeks gave the name
            of the Burnt Land. It lies to the east of Sardes in the upper
            valley of the Hermus, and covers an area of about fifty miles by
            forty. As described by Strabo, the country was wholly treeless
            except for the vines, which produced a wine inferior to none of
            the most famous vintages of antiquity. The surface of the plains
            was like ashes; the hills were composed of black stone, as if
            they had been scorched by fire. Some people laid the scene of
            Typhon's battle with the gods in this Black Country, and supposed
            that it had been burnt by the thunderbolts hurled from heaven at
            the impious monster. The philosophic Strabo, however, held that
            the fires which had wrought this havoc were subterranean, not
            celestial, and he pointed to three craters, at intervals of about
            four miles, each in a hill of scoriae which he supposed to have
            been once molten matter ejected by the volcanoes.<a id=
            "noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> His
            observation and his theory have both been confirmed by modern
            science. The three extinct volcanoes to which he referred are
            still conspicuous features of the landscape. Each is a black cone
            of loose cinders, scoriae, and ashes, with steep sides and a deep
            crater. From each a flood of rugged black lava has flowed forth,
            bursting out at the foot of the cone, and then rushing down the
            dale to the bed of the Hermus. The dark streams follow all the
            sinuosities of the valleys, their sombre hue contrasting with the
            rich verdure of the surrounding landscape. Their surface, broken
            into a thousand fantastic forms, resembles a sea lashed into fury
            by a gale, and then suddenly hardened into <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id=
            "Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stone. Regarded from the
            geological point of view, these black cones of cinders and these
            black rivers of lava are of comparatively recent formation.
            Exposure to the weather for thousands of years has not yet
            softened their asperities and decomposed them into vegetable
            mould; they are as hard and ungenial as if the volcanic stream
            had ceased to flow but yesterday. But in the same district there
            are upwards of thirty other volcanic cones, whose greater age is
            proved by their softened forms, their smoother sides, and their
            mantle of vegetation. Some of them are planted with vineyards to
            their summits.<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href=
            "#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a>
            Thus the volcanic soil is still as favourable to the cultivation
            of the vine as it was in antiquity. The relation between the two
            was noted by the ancients. Strabo compares the vines of the Burnt
            Land with the vineyards of Catania fertilized by the ashes of
            Mount Etna; and he tells us that some ingenious persons explained
            the fire-born Dionysus as a myth of the grapes fostered by
            volcanic agency.<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href=

            inhabitants of these regions were reminded of the slumbering
            fires by other and less agreeable tokens than the generous juice
            of their grapes. For not the Burnt Land only but the country to
            the south, including the whole valley of the Maeander, was
            subject to frequent and violent shocks of earthquake. The soil
            was loose, friable, and full of salts, the ground hollow,
            undermined by fire and water. In particular the city of
            Philadelphia was a great centre of disturbance. The shocks there,
            we are told, were continuous. The houses rocked, the walls
            cracked and gaped; the few inhabitants were kept busy repairing
            the breaches or buttressing and propping the edifices which
            threatened to tumble <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg

            about their ears. Most of the citizens, indeed, had the prudence
            to dwell dispersed on their farms. It was a marvel, says Strabo,
            that such a city should have any inhabitants at all, and a still
            greater marvel that it should ever have been built.<a id=

            However, by a wise dispensation of Providence, the earthquakes
            which shook the foundations of their houses only strengthened
            those of their faith. The people of Apameia, whose town was
            repeatedly devastated, paid their devotions with great fervour to
            Poseidon, the earthquake god.<a id="noteref_574" name=

            Again, the island of Santorin, in the Greek Archipelago, has been
            for thousands of years a great theatre of volcanic activity. On
            one occasion the waters of the bay boiled and flamed for four
            days, and an island composed of red-hot matter rose gradually, as
            if hoisted by machinery, above the waves. It happened that the
            sovereignty of the seas was then with the Rhodians, those
            merchant-princes whose prudent policy, strict but benevolent
            oligarchy, and beautiful island-city, rich with accumulated
            treasures of native art, rendered them in a sense the Venetians
            of the ancient world. So when the ebullition and heat of the
            eruption had subsided, their sea-captains landed in the new
            island, and founded a sanctuary of Poseidon the Establisher or
            Securer,<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=

            army under King Agesipolis had taken the field, it chanced that
            the ground under their feet was shaken by an earthquake. It was
            evening, and the king was at mess with the officers of his staff.
            No sooner did they feel the shock than, with great presence of
            mind, they rose from their dinner and struck up a popular hymn in
            honour of Poseidon. The soldiers outside the tent took up the

            the earth-shaking god, can only have been to prevail on him to

            giant, and that when he is weary of bearing it on one shoulder he
            shifts it to the other, and so causes the ground to quake. At
            such times, accordingly, they all shout at the top of their
            voices to let him know that there are still people on the earth;
            for otherwise they fear lest, impatient of his burden, he might
            tip it into the sea.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href=

            Manichaeans held a precisely similar theory of earthquakes,
            except that according to them the weary giant transferred his
            burden from one shoulder to the other at the end of every thirty
            years,<a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href=

            view which, at all events, points to the observation of a cycle
            in the recurrence of earthquake shocks. But we are not told that
            these heretics reduced an absurd theory to an absurd practice by
            raising a shout in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
            198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            order to remind the earth-shaker of the inconvenience he was
            putting them to. However, both the theory and the practice are to
            be found in full force in various parts of the East Indies. When
            the Balinese and the Sundanese feel an earthquake they cry out,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Still alive,”</span> or <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“We still live,”</span> to acquaint the earth-shaking
            god or giant with their existence.<a id="noteref_584" name=

            natives of Leti, Moa, and Lakor, islands of the Indian
            Archipelago, imagine that earthquakes are caused by Grandmother
            Earth in order to ascertain whether her descendants are still to
            the fore. So they make loud noises for the purpose of satisfying
            her grandmotherly solicitude.<a id="noteref_585" name=

            Tami of German New Guinea ascribe earthquakes to a certain old
            Panku who sits under a great rock; when he stirs, the earth
            quakes. If the shock lasts a long time they beat on the ground
            with palm-branches, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“You down
            there! easy a little! We men are still here.”</span><a id=

            Shans of Burma are taught by Buddhist monks that under the world
            there sleeps a great fish with his tail in his mouth, but
            sometimes he wakes, bites his tail, and quivering with pain
            causes the ground to quiver and shake likewise. That is the cause
            of great earthquakes. But the cause of little earthquakes is
            different. These are produced by little men who live underground
            and sometimes feeling lonely knock on the roof of the world over
            their heads; these knockings we perceive as slight shocks of
            earthquakes. When Shans feel such a shock, they run out of their
            houses, kneel down, and answer the little men saying,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We are here! We are here!”</span><a id=

            Earthquakes are common in the Pampa del Sacramento of Eastern
            Peru. The Conibos, a tribe of Indians on the left bank of the
            great Ucayali River, attribute these disturbances to the creator,
            who usually resides in heaven, but comes down from time to time
            to see whether the work of his hands still exists. The result of
            his descent is an earthquake. So when one happens, these Indians
            rush out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
            199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of their huts with extravagant gestures shouting, as if in answer
            to a question, <span class="tei tei-q">“A moment, a moment, here
            I am, father, here I am!”</span> Their intention is, no doubt, to
            assure their heavenly father that they are still alive, and that
            he may return to his mansion on high with an easy mind. They
            never remember the creator nor pay him any heed except at an
            earthquake.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href=

            Africa the Atonga tribe of Lake Nyassa used to believe that an
            earthquake was the voice of God calling to inquire whether his
            people were all there. So when the rumble was heard underground
            they all shouted in answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ye,
            ye</span></span>,”</span> and some of them went to the mortars
            used for pounding corn and beat on them with pestles. They
            thought that if any one of them did not thus answer to the divine
            call he would die.<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href=

            Ourwira the people think that an earthquake is caused by a dead
            sultan marching past underground; so they stand up to do him
            honour, and some raise their hands to the salute. Were they to
            omit these marks of respect to the deceased, they would run the
            risk of being swallowed up alive.<a id="noteref_590" name=

            Baganda of Central Africa used to attribute earthquakes to a
            certain god named Musisi, who lived underground and set the earth
            in a tremor when he moved about. At such times persons who had
            fetishes to hand patted them and begged the god to be still;
            women who were with child patted their bellies to keep the god
            from taking either their own life or that of their unborn babes;
            others raised a shrill cry to induce him to remain quiet.<a id=

            the words are a jeer or taunt levelled at that mischievous

            broke, and at the same moment Naga-padoha budged under his
            burden. Therefore Batara-guru said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold

            And that is why the Bataks call out <span class="tei tei-q">“The

            works of man.<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href=

            on a winter night, overwhelmed by the billows; and its

            Nothing could be more natural than that to people familiar with
            the twofold calamity the dreadful god of the earthquake and of
            the sea should appear to be one and the same. The historian
            Diodorus Siculus observes that Peloponnese was deemed to have
            been in ancient days the abode of Poseidon, that the whole
            country was in a manner sacred to him, and that every city in it
            worshipped him above all the gods. The devotion to Poseidon he
            explains partly by the earthquakes and floods by which the land
            has been visited, partly by the remarkable chasms and
            subterranean rivers which are a conspicuous feature of its
            limestone mountains.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href=

            birds, and even the bones of men, all killed by the abundant
            emanations of carbonic acid gas which exhale from the soil.
            Animals let down into it die in a few minutes. The whole range of
            hills is volcanic. Two neighbouring craters constantly emit
            smoke.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href=

            place is a glen, partly wooded with chestnut trees, among
            limestone hills, distant about four miles from the town of
            Frigento. Here, under a steep shelving bank of decomposed
            limestone, there is a pool of dark ash-coloured water, which
            continually bubbles up with an explosion like distant thunder. A
            rapid stream of the same blackish water rushes into the pool from
            under the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg

            barren rocky hill, but the fall is not more than a few feet. A
            little higher up are apertures in the ground, through which warm
            blasts of sulphuretted hydrogen are constantly issuing with more
            or less noise, according to the size of the holes. These blasts
            are no doubt what the ancients deemed the breath of Pluto. The
            pool is now called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Mefite</span></span> and the holes
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Mefitinelle</span></span>. On the other side
            of the pool is a smaller pond called the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Coccaio</span></span>, or Cauldron, because
            it appears to be perpetually boiling. Thick masses of mephitic
            vapour, visible a hundred yards off, float in rapid undulations
            on its surface. The exhalations given off by these waters are
            sometimes fatal, especially when they are borne on a high wind.
            But as the carbonic acid gas does not naturally rise more than
            two or three feet from the ground, it is possible in calm weather
            to walk round the pools, though to stoop is difficult and to fall
            would be dangerous. The ancient temple of Mefitis has been
            replaced by a shrine of the martyred Santa Felicita.<a id=

            Thymbria there was a sacred cave which gave out deadly
            emanations, and the place was deemed a sanctuary of Charon.<a id=

            similar cave might be seen at the village of Acharaca near Nysa,
            in the valley of the Maeander. Here, below the cave, there was a
            fine grove with a temple dedicated to Pluto and Persephone. The
            place was sacred to Pluto, yet sick people resorted to it for the
            restoration of their health. They lived in the neighbouring
            village, and the priests prescribed for them according to the
            revelations which they received from the two deities in dreams.
            Often the priests would take the patients to the cave and leave
            them there for days without food. Sometimes the sufferers
            themselves were favoured with revelations in dreams, but
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name=
            "Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they always acted
            under the spiritual direction of the priests. To all but the sick
            the place was unapproachable and fatal. Once a year a festival
            was held in the village, and then afflicted folk came in crowds
            to be rid of their ailments. About the hour of noon on that day a
            number of athletic young men, their naked bodies greased with
            oil, used to carry a bull up to the cave and there let it go. But
            the beast had not taken a few steps into the cavern before it
            fell to the ground and expired: so deadly was the vapour.<a id=

            Here under a brow of the hill there was a deep cave with a narrow
            mouth just large enough to admit the body of a man. A square
            space in front of the cave was railed off, and within the railing
            there hung so thick a cloudy vapour that it was hardly possible
            to see the ground. In calm weather people could step up to the
            railing with safety, but to pass within it was instant death.
            Bulls driven into the enclosure fell to the earth and were
            dragged out lifeless; and sparrows, which spectators by way of
            experiment allowed to fly into the mist, dropped dead at once.
            Yet the eunuch priests of the Great Mother Goddess could enter
            the railed-off area with impunity; nay more, they used to go up
            to the very mouth of the cave, stoop, and creep into it for a
            certain distance, holding their breath; but there was a look on
            their faces as if they were being choked. Some people ascribed
            the immunity of the priests to the divine protection, others to
            the use of antidotes.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href=

            may have been destroyed by an earthquake. But another marvel of
            the Sacred City remains to this day. The hot springs with their
            calcareous deposit, which, like a wizard's wand, turns all that
            it touches to stone, excited the wonder of the ancients, and the
            course of ages has only enhanced the fantastic splendour of the
            great transformation scene. The stately ruins of Hierapolis
            occupy a broad shelf or terrace on the mountain-side commanding
            distant views of extraordinary beauty and grandeur, from the dark
            precipices and dazzling snows of Mount Cadmus away to the burnt
            summits of Phrygia, fading in rosy tints into the blue of the
            sky. Hills, broken by wooded ravines, rise behind the city. In
            front the terrace falls away in cliffs three hundred feet high
            into the desolate treeless valley of the Lycus. Over the face of
            these cliffs the hot streams have poured or trickled for
            thousands of years, encrusting them with a pearly white substance
            like salt or driven snow. The appearance of the whole is as if a
            mighty river, some two miles broad, had been suddenly arrested in
            the act of falling over a great cliff and transformed into white
            marble. It is a petrified Niagara. The illusion is strongest in
            winter or in cool summer mornings when the mist from the hot
            springs hangs in the air, like a veil of spray resting on the
            foam of the waterfall. A closer inspection of the white cliff,
            which attracts the traveller's attention at a distance of twenty
            miles, only adds to its beauty and changes one illusion for
            another. For now it seems to be a glacier, its long pendent
            stalactites looking like icicles, and the snowy whiteness of its
            smooth expanse being tinged here and there with delicate hues of
            blue, rose and green, all the colours of the rainbow. These
            petrified cascades of Hierapolis are among the wonders of the
            world. Indeed they have probably been without a rival in their
            kind ever since the famous white and pink terraces or staircases
            of Rotomahana in New Zealand were destroyed by a volcanic
            eruption.</p>

            pomegranate-trees overhang the little lake and add to its charm.
            Yet the enchanted spot has its dangers. Bubbles of carbonic acid
            gas rise incessantly from the bottom and mount like flickering
            particles of silver to the surface. Birds and beasts which come
            to drink of the water are sometimes found dead on the bank,
            stifled by the noxious vapour; and the villagers tell of bathers
            who have been overpowered by it and drowned, or dragged down, as
            they say, to death by the water-spirit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The streams of
            hot water, no longer regulated by the care of a religious
            population, have for centuries been allowed to overflow their
            channels and to spread unchecked over the tableland. By the
            deposit which they leave behind they have raised the surface of
            the ground many feet, their white ridges concealing the ruins and
            impeding the footstep, except where the old channels, filled up
            solidly to the brim, now form hard level footpaths, from which
            the traveller may survey the strange scene without quitting the
            saddle. In antiquity the husbandmen used purposely to lead the
            water in rills round their lands, and thus in a few years their
            fields and vineyards were enclosed with walls of solid stone. The
            water was also peculiarly adapted for the dyeing of woollen
            stuffs. Tinged with dyes extracted from certain roots, it
            imparted to cloths dipped in it the finest shades of purple and

            doubt that Hierapolis owed its reputation as a holy city in great
            part to its hot springs and mephitic vapours. The curative virtue
            of mineral and thermal springs was well known to the ancients,
            and it would be interesting, if it were possible, to trace the
            causes which have gradually eliminated the superstitious element
            from the use of such waters, and so converted many old seats of
            volcanic religion into the medicinal baths of modern times. It
            was an article of Greek faith that all hot springs were sacred to
            Hercules.<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href=

            the strength of his connexion with medicinal springs Hercules set
            up as a patron of the healing art. In heaven, if we can trust
            Lucian, he even refused to give place to Aesculapius himself, and
            the difference between the two deities led to a very unseemly
            brawl. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mean to say,”</span>
            demanded Hercules of his father Zeus, in a burst of indignation,

            acrimony, recalling certain painful episodes in the private life
            of the burly hero. Finally the dispute was settled by Zeus, who
            decided in favour of Aesculapius on the ground that he died
            before Hercules, and was therefore entitled to rank as senior

            They exist to this day apparently unchanged, although the
            recession of the sea has converted what used to be a narrow pass
            into a wide, swampy flat, through which the broad but shallow,
            turbid stream of the Sperchius creeps sluggishly seaward. On the
            other side the rugged mountains descend in crags and precipices
            to the pass, their grey rocky sides tufted with low wood or
            bushes wherever vegetation can find a foothold, and their summits
            fringed along the sky-line with pines. They remind a Scotchman of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“crags, knolls, and mounds confusedly
            hurled”</span> in which Ben Venue comes down to the Silver Strand
            of Loch Katrine. The principal spring bursts from the rocks just
            at the foot of the steepest and loftiest part of the range. After
            forming a small pool it flows in a rapid stream eastward,
            skirting the foot of the mountains. The water is so hot that it
            is almost painful to hold the hands in it, at least near the
            source, and steam rises thickly from its surface along the course
            of the brook. Indeed the clouds of white steam and the strong
            sulphurous smell acquaint the traveller with his approach to the
            famous spot before he comes in sight of the springs. The water is
            clear, but has the appearance of being of a deep sea-blue or
            sea-green <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
            211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            colour. This appearance it takes from the thick, slimy deposits
            of blue-green sulphur which line the bed of the stream. From its
            source the blue, steaming, sulphur-reeking brook rushes eastward
            for a few hundred yards at the foot of the mountain, and is then
            joined by the water of another spring, which rises much more
            tranquilly in a sort of natural bath among the rocks. The sides
            of this bath are not so thickly coated with sulphur as the banks
            of the stream; hence its water, about two feet deep, is not so
            blue. Just beyond it there is a second and larger bath, which,
            from its square shape and smooth sides, would seem to be in part
            artificial. These two baths are probably the Pots mentioned by
            ancient writers. They are still used by bathers, and a few wooden
            dressing-rooms are provided for the accommodation of visitors.
            Some of the water is conducted in an artificial channel to turn a
            mill about half a mile off at the eastern end of the pass. The
            rest crosses the flat to find its way to the sea. In its passage
            it has coated the swampy ground with a white crust, which sounds
            hollow under the tread.<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633"

            laying the scene of his fiery death on the top of the
            neighbouring Mount Oeta. The district is volcanic, and has often

            Across the strait the island of Euboea has suffered from the same
            cause and at the same time; and on its southern shore sulphureous

            in the days of Plutarch the neighbouring town of Aedepsus,
            situated in a green valley about two miles from the springs, was
            one of the most fashionable resorts of Greece. Elegant and
            commodious buildings, an agreeable country, and abundance of fish
            and game united with the health-giving properties of the baths to
            draw crowds of idlers to the place, especially in the prime of
            the glorious Greek spring, the height of the season at Aedepsus.
            While some watched the dancers dancing or listened to the strains
            of the harp, others passed the time in discourse, lounging in the
            shade of cloisters or pacing the shore of the beautiful strait
            with its prospect of mountains beyond mountains immortalized in

            all this Greek elegance and luxury hardly a vestige remains. Yet
            the healing springs flow now as freely as of old. In the course
            of time the white and yellow calcareous deposit which the water
            leaves behind it, has formed a hillock at the foot of the
            mountains, and the stream now falls in a steaming cascade from

            Once, after an earthquake, the springs ceased to flow for three
            days, and at the same time the hot springs of Thermopylae dried

            incident proves the relation of these Baths of Hercules on both
            sides of the strait to each other and to volcanic agency. On
            another occasion a cold spring suddenly burst out beside the hot
            springs of Aedepsus, and as its water was supposed to be
            peculiarly beneficial to health, patients hastened from far and
            near to drink of it. But the generals of King Antigonus, anxious
            to raise a revenue, imposed a tax on the use of the water; and
            the spring, as if in disgust at being turned to so base a use,
            disappeared as suddenly as it had come.<a id="noteref_640" name=

            fertility and destruction, and that the death of Hercules in the
            flames seems to connect him with the fiery element. Further, the
            apparent conflict of the two principles is by no means as
            absolute as at first sight we might be tempted to suppose; for
            heat is as necessary as moisture to the support of animal and
            vegetable life. Even volcanic fires have their beneficent aspect,
            since their products lend a more generous flavour to the juice of
            the grape. The ancients themselves, as we have seen, perceived
            the connexion between good wine and volcanic soil, and proposed
            more or less seriously to interpret the vine-god Dionysus as a
            child of the fire.<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href=

            they do at the famous hot springs in the land of Moab which flow
            through a wild gorge into the Dead Sea. In antiquity the springs
            went by the Greek name of Callirrhoe, the Fair-flowing. It was to
            them that the dying Herod, weighed down by a complication of
            disorders which the pious Jews traced to God's vengeance,
            repaired in the vain hope of arresting or mitigating the fatal
            progress of disease. The healing waters brought no alleviation of
            his sufferings, and he retired to Jericho to die.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a> The
            hot springs burst in various places from the sides of a deep
            romantic ravine to form a large and rapid stream of lukewarm
            water, which rushes down the depths of the lynn, dashing and
            foaming over boulders, under the dense shade of tamarisk-trees
            and cane-brakes, the rocks on either bank draped with an emerald
            fringe of maidenhair fern. One of the springs falls from a high
            rocky shelf over the face of a cliff which is tinted bright
            yellow by the sulphurous water. The lofty crags which shut in the
            narrow chasm are bold and imposing in outline and varied in
            colour, for they range from red sandstone through white and
            yellow limestone to black basalt. The waters issue from the line
            where the sandstone and limestone meet. Their temperature is
            high, and from great clefts in the mountain-sides you may see
            clouds of steam rising and hear the rumbling of the running
            waters. The bottom of the glen is clothed and half choked with
            rank vegetation; for, situated far below the level of the sea,
            the hot ravine is almost African in climate and flora. Here grow
            dense thickets of canes with their feathery tufts that shake and
            nod in every passing breath of wind: here the oleander flourishes
            with its dark-green glossy foliage and its beautiful pink
            blossoms: here tall date-palms rear their stately heads wherever
            the hot springs flow. Gorgeous flowers, too, carpet the ground.
            Splendid orobanches, some pinkish purple, some bright yellow,
            grow in large tufts, each flower-stalk more than three feet high,
            and covered with blossoms from the ground upwards. An exquisite
            rose-coloured geranium abounds among the stones; and where the
            soil is a little richer than <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            stock, while the crannies of the rocks are gay with scarlet
            ranunculus and masses of sorrel and cyclamen. Over all this
            luxuriant vegetation flit great butterflies of brilliant hues.
            Looking down the far-stretching gorge to its mouth you see in the
            distance the purple hills of Judah framed between walls of black
            basaltic columns on the one side and of bright red sandstone on
            the other.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every year in
            the months of April and May the Arabs resort in crowds to the
            glen to benefit by the waters. They take up their quarters in
            huts made of the reeds which they cut in the thickets. They bathe
            in the steaming water, or allow it to splash on their bodies as
            it gushes in a powerful jet from a crevice in the rocks. But
            before they indulge in these ablutions, the visitors, both Moslem
            and Christian, propitiate the spirit or genius of the place by
            sacrificing a sheep or goat at the spring and allowing its red
            blood to tinge the water. Then they bathe in what they call the
            Baths of Solomon. Legend runs that Solomon the Wise made his
            bathing-place here, and in order to keep the water always warm he
            commanded the jinn never to let the fire die down. The jinn obey
            his orders to this day, but sometimes they slacken their efforts,
            and then the water runs low and cool. When the bathers perceive
            that, they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Solomon, bring green
            wood, dry wood,”</span> and no sooner have they said so than the
            water begins to gurgle and steam as before. Sick people tell the
            saint or sheikh, who lives invisible in the springs, all about
            their ailments; they point out to him the precise spot that is
            the seat of the malady, it may be the back, or the head, or the
            legs; and if the heat of the water diminishes, they call out,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy bath is cold, O sheikh, thy bath is
            cold!”</span> whereupon the obliging sheikh stokes up the fire,
            and out comes the water boiling. But if in spite of their
            remonstrances the temperature of the spring <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id=
            "Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> continues low, they say that
            the sheikh has gone on pilgrimage, and they shout to him to
            hasten his return. Barren Moslem women also visit these hot
            springs to obtain children, and they do the same at the similar
            baths near Kerak. At the latter place a childless woman has been
            known to address the spirit of the waters saying, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“O sheikh Solomon, I am not yet an old woman; give me
            children.”</span><a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href=

            respect thus paid by Arab men and women to the sheikh Solomon at
            his hot springs may help us to understand the worship which at
            similar spots Greek men and women used to render to the hero
            Hercules. As the ideal of manly strength he may have been deemed
            the father of many of his worshippers, and Greek wives may have
            gone on pilgrimage to his steaming waters in order to obtain the
            wish of their hearts.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The largest
            active crater in the world is Kirauea in Hawaii. It is a huge
            cauldron, several miles in circumference and hundreds of feet
            deep, the bottom of which is filled with boiling lava in a state
            of terrific ebullition; from the red surge rise many black cones
            or insulated craters belching columns of grey smoke or pyramids
            of brilliant flame from their roaring mouths, while torrents of
            blazing lava roll down their sides to flow into the molten,
            tossing sea of fire below. The scene is especially impressive by
            night, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
            217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            when flames of sulphurous blue or metallic red sweep across the
            heaving billows of the infernal lake, casting a broad glare on
            the jagged sides of the insulated craters, which shoot up eddying
            streams of fire with a continuous roar, varied at frequent
            intervals by loud detonations, as spherical masses of fusing lava
            or bright ignited stones are hurled into the air.<a id=

            the imagination of the natives and filled it with ideas of the
            dreadful beings who inhabit the fiery abyss. They considered the
            great crater, we are told, as the primaeval abode of their
            volcanic deities: the black cones that rise like islands from the
            burning lake appeared to them the houses where the gods often
            amused themselves by playing at draughts: the roaring of the
            furnaces and the crackling of the flames were the music of their
            dance; and the red flaming surge was the surf wherein they
            played, sportively swimming on the rolling wave.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For these
            fearful divinities they had appropriate names; one was the King
            of Steam or Vapour, another the Rain of Night, another the
            Husband of Thunder, another the Child of War with a Spear of
            Fire, another the Fiery-eyed Canoe-breaker, another the Red-hot
            Mountain holding or lifting Clouds, and so on. But above them all
            was the great goddess Pélé. All were dreaded: they never
            journeyed on errands of mercy but only to receive offerings or to
            execute vengeance; and their arrival in any place was announced
            by the convulsive trembling of the earth, by the lurid light of
            volcanic eruption, by the flash of lightning, and the clap of
            thunder. The whole island was bound to pay them tribute or
            support their temples and devotees; and whenever the chiefs or
            people failed to send the proper offerings, or incurred their
            displeasure by insulting them or their priests or breaking the
            taboos which should be observed round about the craters, they
            filled the huge cauldron on the top of Kirauea with molten lava,
            and spouted the fiery liquid on the surrounding country; or they
            would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
            218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            march to some of their other houses, which mortals call craters,
            in the neighbourhood of the sinners, and rushing forth in a river
            or column of fire overwhelm the guilty. If fishermen did not
            bring them enough fish from the sea, they would go down, kill all
            the fish, fill the shoals with lava, and so destroy the
            fishing-grounds. Hence, when the volcano was in active eruption
            or threatened to break out, the people used to cast vast numbers
            of hogs, alive or dead, into the craters or into the rolling
            torrent of lava in order to appease the gods and arrest the
            progress of the fiery stream.<a id="noteref_652" name=

            pluck certain sacred berries, which grow on the mountain, to dig
            sand on its slopes, or to throw stones into the crater were acts
            particularly offensive to the deities, who would instantly rise
            in volumes of smoke, crush the offender under a shower of stones,
            or so involve him in thick darkness and rain that he could never
            find his way home. However, it was lawful to pluck and eat of the
            sacred berries, if only a portion of them were first offered to
            the goddess Pélé. The offerer would take a branch laden with
            clusters of the beautiful red and yellow berries, and standing on
            the edge of the abyss and looking towards the place where the
            smoke rose in densest volumes, he would say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Pélé, here are your berries: I offer some to you,
            some I also eat.”</span> With that he would throw some of the
            berries into the crater and eat the rest.<a id="noteref_653"

            kind of brittle volcanic glass, of a dark-olive colour and
            semi-transparent, is found on the mountain in the shape of
            filaments as fine as human hair; the natives call it the hair of
            the goddess Pélé.<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href=

            Worshippers used to cast locks of their own hair into the crater
            of Kirauea as an offering to the dreadful goddess who dwelt in
            it. She had also a temple at the bottom of a valley, where stood
            a number of rude stone idols wrapt in white and yellow cloth.
            Once a year the priests and devotees of Pélé assembled there to
            perform certain rites and to feast on hogs, dogs, and fruit,
            which the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
            219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            pious inhabitants of Hamakua brought to the holy place in great
            abundance. This annual festival was intended to propitiate the
            volcanic goddess and thereby to secure the country from
            earthquakes and floods of molten lava.<a id="noteref_655" name=

            goddess of the volcano was supposed to inspire people, though to
            the carnal eye the inspiration resembled intoxication. One of
            these inspired priestesses solemnly affirmed to an English
            missionary that she was the goddess Pélé herself and as such
            immortal. Assuming a haughty air, she said, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I am Pélé; I shall never die; and those who follow
            me, when they die, if part of their bones be taken to Kirauea
            (the name of the volcano), will live with me in the bright fires
            there.”</span><a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href=

            who have been burnt to death in the crater will join the host of
            demons in the fiery furnace, mitigate their fury, and induce them
            to spare the works and the life of man. But, however we may
            explain the custom, it has been usual in various parts of the
            world to throw human beings as well as less precious offerings
            into the craters of active volcanoes. Thus the Indians of
            Nicaragua used to sacrifice men, women, and children to the
            active volcano Massaya, flinging them into the craters: we are
            told that the victims went willingly to their fate.<a id=

            the island of Siao, to the north of Celebes, a child was formerly
            sacrificed every year in order to keep the volcano Goowoong Awoo
            quiet. The poor wretch was tortured to death at a festival which
            lasted nine days. In later times the place of the child has
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name=

            Galelareese of Halmahera say that the Sultan of Ternate used
            annually to require some human victims, who were cast into the
            crater of the volcano to save the island from its ravages.<a id=

            Java the volcano Bromo or Bromok is annually worshipped by people
            who throw offerings of coco-nuts, plantains, mangoes, rice,

            crater.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=

            the Tenggereese, an aboriginal heathen tribe inhabiting the
            mountains of which Bromo is the central crater, the festival of
            making offerings to the volcano is the greatest of the year. It
            is held at full moon in the twelfth month, the day being fixed by
            the high priest. Each household prepares its offerings the night
            before. Very early in the morning the people set out by moonlight
            for Mount Bromo, men, women, and children all arrayed in their
            best. Before they reach the mountain they must cross a wide sandy
            plain, where the spirits of the dead are supposed to dwell until
            by means of the Festival of the Dead they obtain admittance to
            the volcano. It is a remarkable sight to see thousands of people
            streaming across the level sands from three different directions.
            They have to descend into it from the neighbouring heights, and
            the horses break into a gallop when, after the steep descent,
            they reach the level. The gay and varied colours of the dresses,
            the fantastic costumes of the priests, the offerings borne along,
            the whole lit up by the warm beams of the rising sun, lend to the
            spectacle a peculiar charm. All assemble at the foot of the
            crater, where a market is held for offerings and refreshments.
            The scene is a lively one, for hundreds of people must now pay
            the vows which they made during the year. The priests sit in a
            long row on mats, and when the high priest appears the people
            pray, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bromo, we thank thee for
            all thy gifts and benefits with which thou ever blessest us, and
            for which we offer thee our thank-offerings to-day. Bless us, our
            children, and our children's children.”</span> The prayers over,
            the high priest gives a signal, and the whole multitude arises
            and climbs the mountain. On reaching the edge of the <span class=

            blesses the offerings of food, clothes, and money, which are then
            thrown into the crater. Yet few of them reach the spirits for
            whom they are intended; for a swarm of urchins now scrambles down
            into the crater, and at more or less risk to life and limb
            succeeds in appropriating the greater part of the offerings. The
            spirits, defrauded of their dues, must take the will for the
            deed.<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href=

            Tradition says that once in a time of dearth a chief vowed to
            sacrifice one of his children to the volcano, if the mountain
            would bless the people with plenty of food. His prayer was
            answered, and he paid his vow by casting his youngest son as a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
          dealt with the myth of Adonis and the legends which associated him
          with Byblus and Paphos. A discussion of these legends led us to the
          conclusion that among Semitic peoples in early times, Adonis, the
          divine lord of the city, was often personated by priestly kings or
          other members of the royal family, and that these his human
          representatives were of old put to death, whether periodically or
          occasionally, in their divine character. Further, we found that
          certain traditions and monuments of Asia Minor seem to preserve
          traces of a similar practice. As time went on, the cruel custom was
          apparently mitigated in various ways; for example, by substituting
          an effigy or an animal for the man, or by allowing the destined
          victim to escape with a merely make-believe sacrifice. The evidence
          of all this is drawn from a variety of scattered and often
          ambiguous indications: it is fragmentary, it is uncertain, and the
          conclusions built upon it inevitably partake of the weakness of the
          foundation. Where the records are so imperfect, as they happen to
          be in this branch of our subject, the element of hypothesis must
          enter largely into any attempt to piece together and interpret the
          disjointed facts. How far the interpretations here proposed are
          sound, I leave to future inquiries to determine.</p>

          at different places the ceremonies varied somewhat in the manner
          and apparently also in the season of their celebration. At
          Alexandria images of Aphrodite and Adonis were displayed on two
          couches; beside them were set ripe fruits of all kinds, cakes,
          plants growing in flower-pots, and green bowers twined with anise.
          The marriage of the lovers was celebrated one day, and on the

          image of the dead Adonis to the sea-shore and committed it to the

          next day he was believed to come to life again and ascend up to
          heaven in the presence of his worshippers. The disconsolate
          believers, left behind on earth, shaved their heads as the

          season the red earth washed down from the mountains by the rain
          tinges the water of the river, and even the sea, for a great way
          with a blood-red hue, and the crimson stain was believed to be the

          Naaman (<span class="tei tei-q">“darling”</span>), which seems to

          red rose also was said to owe its hue to the same sad occasion; for
          Aphrodite, hastening to her wounded lover, trod on a bush of white
          roses; the cruel thorns tore her tender flesh, and her sacred blood
          dyed the white roses for ever red.<a id="noteref_676" name=

          would be idle, perhaps, to lay much weight on evidence drawn from
          the calendar of flowers, and in particular to press an argument so
          fragile as the bloom of the rose. Yet so far as it counts at all,
          the tale which links the damask rose with the death of Adonis
          points to a summer rather than to a spring celebration of his
          passion. In Attica, certainly, the festival fell at the height of
          summer. For the fleet which Athens fitted out against Syracuse, and
          by the destruction of which her power was permanently crippled,
          sailed at midsummer, and by an ominous coincidence the sombre rites
          of Adonis were being celebrated at the very time. As the troops
          marched down to the harbour to embark, the streets through which
          they passed were lined with coffins and corpse-like effigies, and
          the air was rent with the noise of women wailing for the dead
          Adonis. The circumstance cast a gloom over the sailing of the most
          splendid armament that Athens ever sent to sea.<a id="noteref_677"

          when the Emperor Julian made his first entry into Antioch, he found
          in like manner the gay, the luxurious capital of the East plunged
          in mimic grief for the annual death of Adonis: and if he had any
          presentiment of coming evil, the voices of lamentation which struck
          upon his ear must have seemed to sound his knell.<a id=

          the similarity of these customs to each other and to the spring and
          midsummer customs of modern Europe we should naturally expect that
          they all admit of a common explanation. Hence, if the explanation
          which I have adopted of the latter is correct, the ceremony of the
          death and resurrection of Adonis must also have been a dramatic
          representation of the decay and revival of plant life. The
          inference thus based on the resemblance of the customs is confirmed
          by the following features in the legend and ritual of Adonis. His
          affinity with vegetation comes out at once in the common story of
          his birth. He was said to have been born from a myrrh-tree, the
          bark of which bursting, after a ten month' gestation, allowed the
          lovely infant to come forth. According to some, a boar rent the
          bark with his tusk and so opened a passage for the babe. A faint
          rationalistic colour was given to the legend by saying that his
          mother was a woman named Myrrh, who had been <span class=

          use of myrrh as incense at the festival of Adonis may have given
          rise to the fable.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href=

          was no other than Astarte. Again, the story that Adonis spent half,
          or according to others a third, of the year in the lower world and
          the rest of it in the upper world,<a id="noteref_685" name=
          "noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class=

          explained most simply and naturally by supposing that he
          represented vegetation, especially the corn, which lies buried in
          earth half the year and reappears above ground the other half.
          Certainly of the annual phenomena of nature there is none which
          suggests so obviously the idea of death and resurrection as the
          disappearance and reappearance of vegetation in autumn and spring.
          Adonis has been taken for the sun; but there is nothing in the
          sun's annual course within the temperate and tropical zones to
          suggest that he is dead for half or a third of the year and alive
          for the other half or two-thirds. He might, indeed, be conceived as
          weakened in winter, but dead he could not be thought to be; his
          daily reappearance contradicts the supposition.<a id="noteref_686"
          name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class=

          Within the Arctic Circle, where the sun annually disappears for a
          continuous period which varies from twenty-four hours to six months
          according to the latitude, his yearly death and resurrection would
          certainly be an obvious idea; but no one except the unfortunate
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> has
          maintained that the Adonis worship came from the Arctic regions. On
          the other hand, the annual death and revival of vegetation is a
          conception which readily presents itself to men in every stage of
          savagery and civilization; and the vastness of the scale on which
          this ever-recurring decay and regeneration takes place, together
          with man's intimate dependence on it for subsistence, combine to
          render it the most impressive annual occurrence in nature, at least
          within the temperate zones. It is no wonder that a phenomenon so
          important, so striking, and so universal should, by suggesting
          similar ideas, have given rise to similar rites in many lands. We
          may, therefore, accept as probable an explanation of the Adonis
          worship which accords so well with the facts of nature and with the
          analogy of similar rites in other lands. Moreover, the explanation
          is countenanced by a considerable body of opinion amongst the
          ancients themselves, who again and again interpreted the dying and
          reviving god as the reaped and sprouting grain.<a id="noteref_688"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Tammuz (July). In the middle of this month

          concentration, so to say, of the nature of Adonis upon the cereal
          crops is characteristic of the stage of culture reached by his
          worshippers in historical times. They had left the nomadic life of
          the wandering hunter and herdsman far behind them; for ages they
          had been settled on the land, and had depended for their
          subsistence mainly on the products of tillage. The berries and
          roots of the wilderness, the grass of the pastures, which had been
          matters of vital importance to their ruder forefathers, were now of
          little moment to them: more and more their thoughts and energies
          were engrossed by the staple of their life, the corn; more and more
          accordingly the propitiation of the deities of fertility in general
          and of the corn-spirit in particular tended to become the central
          feature of their religion. The aim they set before themselves in
          celebrating the rites was thoroughly practical. It was no vague
          poetical sentiment which prompted them to hail with joy the rebirth
          of vegetation and to mourn its decline. Hunger, felt or feared, was
          the mainspring of the worship of Adonis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          suggested by Father Lagrange that the mourning for Adonis was
          essentially a harvest rite designed to propitiate the corn-god, who
          was then either perishing under the sickles of the reapers, or
          being trodden to death under the hoofs of the oxen on the
          threshing-floor. While the men slew him, the women wept crocodile
          tears at home to appease his natural indignation by a show of grief
          for his death.<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href=

          theory fits in well with the dates of the festivals, which fell in
          spring or summer; for spring and summer, not autumn, are the
          seasons of the barley and wheat harvests in the lands which,
          worshipped Adonis.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus interpreted
          the death of Adonis is not the natural decay of vegetation in
          general under the summer heat or the winter cold; it is the violent
          destruction of the corn by man, who cuts it down on the field,
          stamps it to pieces on the threshing-floor, and grinds it to powder
          in the mill. That this was indeed the principal aspect in which
          Adonis presented himself in later times to the agricultural peoples
          of the Levant, may be admitted; but whether from the beginning he
          had been the corn and nothing but the corn, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may be doubted. At an earlier period he
          may have been to the herdsman, above all, the tender herbage which
          sprouts after rain, offering rich pasture to the lean and hungry
          cattle. Earlier still he may have embodied the spirit of the nuts
          and berries which the autumn woods yield to the savage hunter and
          his squaw. And just as the husbandman must propitiate the spirit of
          the corn which he consumes, so the herdsman must appease the spirit
          of the grass and leaves which his cattle munch, and the hunter must
          soothe the spirit of the roots which he digs, and of the fruits
          which he gathers from the bough. In all cases the propitiation of
          the injured and angry sprite would naturally comprise elaborate
          excuses and apologies, accompanied by loud lamentations at his
          decease whenever, through some deplorable accident or necessity, he
          happened to be murdered as well as robbed. Only we must bear in
          mind that the savage hunter and herdsman of those early days had
          probably not yet attained to the abstract idea of vegetation in
          general; and that accordingly, so far as Adonis existed for them at
          all, he must have been the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Adon</span></span> or lord of each individual
          tree and plant rather than a personification of vegetable life as a
          whole. Thus there would be as many Adonises as there were trees and
          shrubs, and each of them might expect to receive satisfaction for
          any damage done to his person or property. And year by year, when
          the trees were deciduous, every Adonis would seem to bleed to death
          with the red leaves of autumn and to come to life again with the
          fresh green of spring.</p>

          god. Further, there is evidence which goes to show that among the
          agricultural peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean, the corn-spirit,
          by whatever name he was known, was often represented, year by year,
          by human victims slain on the harvest-field.<a id="noteref_694"
          name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> If
          that was so, it seems likely that the propitiation of the
          corn-spirit would tend to fuse to some extent with the worship of
          the dead. For the spirits of these victims <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> might be thought to return to life in the
          ears which they had fattened with their blood, and to die a second
          death at the reaping of the corn. Now the ghosts of those who have
          perished by violence are surly and apt to wreak their vengeance on
          their slayers whenever an opportunity offers. Hence the attempt to
          appease the souls of the slaughtered victims would naturally blend,
          at least in the popular conception, with the attempt to pacify the
          slain corn-spirit. And as the dead came back in the sprouting corn,
          so they might be thought to return in the spring flowers, waked
          from their long sleep by the soft vernal airs. They had been laid
          to their rest under the sod. What more natural than to imagine that
          the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang
          from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and
          contained some portion of their spirit?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer
          after the battle of Landen, the most sanguinary battle of the
          seventeenth century in Europe, the earth, saturated with the blood
          of twenty thousand slain, broke forth into millions of poppies, and
          the traveller who passed that vast sheet of scarlet might well
          fancy that the earth had indeed given up her dead.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> At
          Athens the great Commemoration of the Dead fell in spring about the
          middle of March, when the early flowers are in bloom. Then the dead
          were believed to rise from their graves and go about the streets,
          vainly endeavoring to enter the temples and the dwellings, which
          were barred against these perturbed spirits with ropes, buckthorn,
          and pitch. The name of the festival, according to the most obvious
          and natural interpretation, means the Festival of Flowers, and the
          title would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
          235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fit well with the substance of the ceremonies if at that season the
          poor ghosts were indeed thought to creep from the narrow house with
          the opening flowers.<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href=
          "#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a> There
          may therefore be a measure of truth in the theory of Renan, who saw
          in the Adonis worship a dreamy voluptuous cult of death, conceived
          not as the King of Terrors, but as an insidious enchanter who lures
          his victims to himself and lulls them into an eternal sleep. The
          infinite charm of nature in the Lebanon, he thought, lends itself
          to religious emotions of this sensuous, visionary sort, hovering
          vaguely between pain and pleasure, between slumber and tears.<a id=
          "noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> It
          would doubtless be a mistake to attribute to Syrian peasants the
          worship of a conception so purely abstract as that of death in
          general. Yet it may be true that in their simple minds the thought
          of the reviving spirit of vegetation was blent with the very
          concrete notion of the ghosts of the dead, who come to life again
          in spring days with the early flowers, with the tender green of the
          corn and the many-tinted blossoms of the trees. Thus their views of
          the death and resurrection of nature would be coloured by their
          views of the death and resurrection of man, by their personal
          sorrows and hopes and fears. In like manner we cannot doubt that
          Renan's theory of Adonis was itself deeply tinged by passionate
          memories, memories of the slumber akin to death which sealed his
          own eyes on the slopes of the Lebanon, memories of the sister who
          sleeps in the land of Adonis never again to wake with the anemones
          and the roses.</p>

          These were baskets or pots filled with earth, in which wheat,
          barley, lettuces, fennel, and various kinds of flowers were sown
          and tended for eight days, chiefly or exclusively by women.
          Fostered by the sun's heat, the plants shot up rapidly, but having
          no root they withered as rapidly away, and at the end of eight days
          were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis, and flung with

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These gardens of
          Adonis are most naturally interpreted as representatives of Adonis
          or manifestations of his power; they represented him, true to his
          original nature, in vegetable form, while the images of him, with
          which they were carried out and cast into the water, portrayed him
          in his later human shape. All these Adonis ceremonies, if I am
          right, were originally intended as charms to promote the growth
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name=
          "Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or revival of
          vegetation; and the principle by which they were supposed to
          produce this effect was homoeopathic or imitative magic. For
          ignorant people suppose that by mimicking the effect which they
          desire to produce they actually help to produce it; thus by
          sprinkling water they make rain, by lighting a fire they make
          sunshine, and so on. Similarly, by mimicking the growth of crops
          they hope to ensure a good harvest. The rapid growth of the wheat
          and barley in the gardens of Adonis was intended to make the corn
          shoot up; and the throwing of the gardens and of the images into
          the water was a charm to secure a due supply of fertilizing
          rain.<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href=
          "#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> The
          same, I take it, was the object of throwing the effigies of Death
          and the Carnival into water in the corresponding ceremonies of
          modern Europe.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href=
          "#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>
          Certainly the custom of drenching with water a leaf-clad person,
          who undoubtedly personifies vegetation, is still resorted to in
          Europe for the express purpose of producing rain.<a id=
          "noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a>
          Similarly the custom of throwing water on the last corn cut at
          harvest, or on the person who brings it home (a custom observed in
          Germany and France, and till quite lately in England and Scotland),
          is in some places practised with the avowed intent to procure rain
          for the next year's crops. Thus in Wallachia and amongst the
          Roumanians in Transylvania, when a girl is bringing home a crown
          made of the last ears of corn cut at harvest, all who meet her
          hasten to throw water on her, and two farm-servants are placed at
          the door for the purpose; for they believe that if this were not
          done, the crops next year would perish from drought.<a id=

          "Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> amongst the Saxons
          of Transylvania, the person who wears the wreath made of the last
          corn cut is drenched with water to the skin; for the wetter he is,
          the better will be next year's harvest, and the more grain there
          will be threashed out. Sometimes the wearer of the wreath is the
          reaper who cut the last corn.<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703"

          Northern Euboea, when the corn-sheaves have been piled in a stack,
          the farmer's wife brings a pitcher of water and offers it to each
          of the labourers that he may wash his hands. Every man, after he
          has washed his hands, sprinkles water on the corn and on the
          threshing-floor, expressing at the same time a wish that the corn
          may last long. Lastly, the farmer's wife holds the pitcher
          slantingly and runs at full speed round the stack without spilling
          a drop, while she utters a wish that the stack may endure as long
          as the circle she has just described.<a id="noteref_704" name=

          the spring ploughing in Prussia, when the ploughmen and sowers
          returned in the evening from their work in the fields, the farmer's
          wife and the servants used to splash water over them. The ploughmen
          and sowers retorted by seizing every one, throwing them into the
          pond, and ducking them under the water. The farmer's wife might
          claim exemption on payment of a forfeit, but every one else had to
          be ducked. By observing this custom they hoped to ensure a due
          supply of rain for the seed.<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705"

          after harvest in Prussia, the person who wore a wreath made of the
          last corn cut was drenched with water, while a prayer was uttered
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“as the corn had sprung up and
          multiplied through the water, so it might spring up and multiply in
          the barn and granary.”</span><a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706"

          Anhalt on the same occasion the farmer is still often sprinkled
          with water by his family; and his men and horses, and even the
          plough, receive the same treatment. The object of the custom, as
          people at Arensdorf explained it, is <span class="tei tei-q">“to

          Hesse, when the ploughmen return with the plough from the field for

          Before the Tusayan Indians of North America go out to plant their
          fields, the women sometimes pour water on them; the reason for
          doing so is that <span class="tei tei-q">“as the water is poured on

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opinion that
          the gardens of Adonis are essentially charms to promote the growth
          of vegetation, especially of the crops, and that they belong to the
          same class of customs as those spring and midsummer folk-customs of
          modern Europe which I have described elsewhere,<a id="noteref_714"
          name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> does
          not rest for its evidence merely on the intrinsic probability of
          the case. Fortunately we are able to show that gardens of Adonis
          (if we may use the expression in a general sense) are still
          planted, first, by a primitive race at their sowing season,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name=
          "Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and, second, by
          European peasants at midsummer. Amongst the Oraons and Mundas of
          Bengal, when the time comes for planting out the rice which has
          been grown in seed-beds, a party of young people of both sexes go
          to the forest and cut a young Karma-tree, or the branch of one.
          Bearing it in triumph they return dancing, singing, and beating
          drums, and plant it in the middle of the village dancing-ground. A
          sacrifice is offered to the tree; and next morning the youth of
          both sexes, linked arm-in-arm, dance in a great circle round the
          Karma-tree, which is decked with strips of coloured cloth and sham
          bracelets and necklets of plaited straw. As a preparation for the
          festival, the daughters of the headman of the village cultivate
          blades of barley in a peculiar way. The seed is sown in moist,
          sandy soil, mixed with turmeric, and the blades sprout and unfold
          of a pale-yellow or primrose colour. On the day of the festival the
          girls take up these blades and carry them in baskets to the
          dancing-ground, where, prostrating themselves reverentially, they
          place some of the plants before the Karma-tree. Finally, the
          Karma-tree is taken away and thrown into a stream or tank.<a id=
          "noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> The
          meaning of planting these barley blades and then presenting them to
          the Karma-tree is hardly open to question. Trees are supposed to
          exercise a quickening influence upon the growth of crops, and
          amongst the very people in question—the Mundas or
          Mundaris—<span class="tei tei-q">“the grove deities are held
          responsible for the crops.”</span><a id="noteref_716" name=
          "noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>
          Therefore, when at the season for planting out the rice the Mundas
          bring in a tree and treat it with so much respect, their object can
          only be to foster thereby the growth of the rice which is about to
          be planted out; and the custom of causing barley blades to sprout
          rapidly and then presenting them to the tree must be intended to
          subserve the same purpose, perhaps by reminding the tree-spirit of
          his duty towards the crops, and stimulating his activity by this
          visible example of rapid vegetable growth. The throwing of the
          Karma-tree into the water is to be interpreted as a rain-charm.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name=
          "Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Whether the barley
          blades are also thrown into the water is not said; but if my
          interpretation of the custom is right, probably they are so. A
          distinction between this Bengal custom and the Greek rites of
          Adonis is that in the former the tree-spirit appears in his
          original form as a tree; whereas in the Adonis worship he appears
          in human form, represented as a dead man, though his vegetable
          nature is indicated by the gardens of Adonis, which are, so to say,
          a secondary manifestation of his original power as a
          tree-spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gardens of
          Adonis are cultivated also by the Hindoos, with the intention
          apparently of ensuring the fertility both of the earth and of
          mankind. Thus at Oodeypoor in Rajputana a festival is held
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in honour of Gouri, or Isani, the goddess
          of abundance, the Isis of Egypt, the Ceres of Greece. Like the
          Rajpoot Saturnalia, which it follows, it belongs to the vernal
          equinox, when nature in these regions proximate to the tropic is in
          the full expanse of her charms, and the matronly Gouri casts her
          golden mantle over the verdant Vassanti, personification of spring.
          Then the fruits exhibit their promise to the eye; the kohil fills
          the ear with melody; the air is impregnated with aroma, and the
          crimson poppy contrasts with the spikes of golden grain to form a
          wreath for the beneficent Gouri. Gouri is one of the names of Isa
          or Parvati, wife of the greatest of the gods, Mahadeva or Iswara,
          who is conjoined with her in these rites, which almost exclusively
          appertain to the women. The meaning of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gouri</span></span> is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘yellow,’</span> emblematic of the ripened harvest,
          when the votaries of the goddess adore her effigies, which are
          those of a matron painted the colour of ripe corn.”</span> The
          rites begin when the sun enters the sign of the Ram, the opening of
          the Hindoo year. An image of the goddess Gouri is made of earth,
          and a smaller one of her husband Iswara, and the two are placed
          together. A small trench is next dug, barley is sown in it, and the
          ground watered and heated artificially till the grain sprouts, when
          the women dance round it hand in hand, invoking the blessing of
          Gouri on their husbands. After that the young corn is taken up and
          distributed by the women to the men, who wear it in their turbans.
          Every wealthy family, or at least every subdivision of the city,
          has its own image. These and other <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> rites, known only to the initiated, occupy
          several days, and are performed within doors. Then the images of
          the goddess and her husband are decorated and borne in procession
          to a beautiful lake, whose deep blue waters mirror the cloudless
          Indian sky, marble palaces, and orange groves. Here the women,
          their hair decked with roses and jessamine carry the image of Gouri
          down a marble staircase to the water's edge, and dance round it
          singing hymns and love-songs. Meantime the goddess is supposed to
          bathe in the water. No men take part in the ceremony; even the
          image of Iswara, the husband-god, attracts little attention.<a id=

          these rites the distribution of the barley shoots to the men, and
          the invocation of a blessing on their husbands by the wives, point
          clearly to the desire of offspring as one motive for observing the
          custom. The same motive probably explains the use of gardens of
          Adonis at the marriage of Brahmans in the Madras Presidency. Seeds
          of five or nine sorts are mixed and sown in earthen pots, which are
          made specially for the purpose and are filled with earth. Bride and
          bridegroom water the seeds both morning and evening for four days;
          and on the fifth day the seedlings are thrown, like the real
          gardens of Adonis, into a tank or river.<a id="noteref_718" name=

          Similar is the barley feast known as Jâyî or Jawâra in Upper India
          and as Bhujariya in the Central Provinces. On the seventh day of

          about the middle of September. None but women may take part in it,
          though crowds of men come to look on. Some little time before the
          festival wheat or other grain has been sown in pots ingeniously
          constructed of large leaves, which are held together by the thorns
          of a species of acacia. Having grown up in the dark, the stalks are
          of a pale colour. On the day appointed these gardens of Adonis, as
          we may call them, are carried towards a lake which abuts on the
          native city. The women of every family or circle of friends bring
          their own pots, and having laid them on the ground they dance round
          them. Then taking the pots of sprouting corn they descend to the
          edge of the water, wash the soil away from the pots, and distribute

          Sardinia the gardens of Adonis are still planted in connexion with
          the great Midsummer festival which bears the name of St. John. At
          the end of March or on the first of April a young man of the
          village presents himself to a girl, and asks her to be his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">comare</span></span> (gossip or sweetheart),
          offering to be her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">compare</span></span>. The invitation is
          considered as an honour by the girl's family, and is gladly
          accepted. At the end of May the girl makes a pot of the bark of the
          cork-tree, fills it with earth, and sows a handful of wheat and
          barley in it. The pot being placed in the sun and often watered,
          the corn sprouts rapidly and has a good head by Midsummer Eve (St.
          John's Eve, the twenty-third of June). The pot is then called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Erme</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          young man and the girl, dressed in their best, accompanied by a
          long retinue and preceded by children gambolling and frolicking,
          move in procession to a church outside the village. Here they break
          the pot by throwing it against the door of the church. Then they
          sit down in a ring on the grass and eat eggs and herbs to the music
          of flutes. Wine is mixed in a cup and passed round, each one
          drinking as it passes. Then they join hands and sing <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sweethearts of St. John”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Compare e comare
          di San Giovanni</span></span>) over and over again, the flutes
          playing the while. When they tire of singing they stand up and
          dance gaily in a ring till evening. This is the general Sardinian
          custom. As practised at Ozieri it has some special features. In May
          the pots are made of cork-bark and planted with corn, as already
          described. Then on the Eve of St. John the window-sills are draped
          with rich cloths, on which the pots are placed, adorned with
          crimson and blue silk and ribbons of various colours. On each of
          the pots they used formerly to place a statuette or cloth doll
          dressed as a woman, or a Priapus-like figure made of paste; but
          this custom, rigorously forbidden by the Church, has fallen into
          disuse. The village swains go about <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in a troop to look at the pots and their
          decorations and to wait for the girls, who assemble on the public
          square to celebrate the festival. Here a great bonfire is kindled,
          round which they dance and make merry. Those who wish to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sweethearts of St. John”</span> act as
          follows. The young man stands on one side of the bonfire and the
          girl on the other, and they, in a manner, join hands by each
          grasping one end of a long stick, which they pass three times
          backwards and forwards across the fire, thus thrusting their hands
          thrice rapidly into the flames. This seals their relationship to
          each other. Dancing and music go on till late at night.<a id=

          answer to the images of Adonis which accompanied his gardens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Customs of the
          same sort are observed at the same season in Sicily. Pairs of boys
          and girls become gossips of St. John on St. John's Day by drawing
          each a hair from his or her head and performing various ceremonies
          over them. Thus they tie the hairs together and throw them up in
          the air, or exchange them over a potsherd, which they afterwards
          break in two, preserving each a fragment with pious care. The tie
          formed in the latter way is supposed to last for life. In some
          parts of Sicily the gossips of St. John present each other with
          plates of sprouting corn, lentils, and canary seed, which have been
          planted forty days before the festival. The one who receives the
          plate pulls a stalk of the young plants, binds it with a ribbon,
          and preserves it among his or her greatest treasures, restoring the
          platter to the giver. At Catania the gossips exchange pots of basil
          and great cucumbers; the girls tend the basil, and the thicker it
          grows the more it is prized.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726"

          John has replaced Adonis. We have seen that the rites of Tammuz or
          Adonis were commonly celebrated about midsummer; according to
          Jerome, their date was June.<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728"
          href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> And
          besides their date and their similarity in respect of the pots of
          herbs and corn, there is another point of affinity between the two
          festivals, the heathen and the Christian. In both of them water
          plays a prominent part. At his midsummer festival in Babylon the
          image of Tammuz, whose name is said to mean <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“true son of the deep water,”</span> was bathed with
          pure water: at his summer festival in Alexandria the image of
          Adonis, with that of his divine mistress Aphrodite, was committed
          to the waves; and at the midsummer celebration in Greece the
          gardens of Adonis were thrown into the sea or into springs. Now a
          great feature of the midsummer festival associated with the name of
          St. John is, or used to be, the custom of bathing in the sea,
          springs, rivers, or the dew on Midsummer Eve or the morning of
          Midsummer Day. Thus, for example, at Naples there is a church
          dedicated to St. John the Baptist under the name of St. John of the
          Sea (<span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "it"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Giovan a
          mare</span></span>); and it was an old practice for men and women
          to bathe in the sea on St. John's Eve, that is, on Midsummer Eve,
          believing that thus all their sins were washed away.<a id=
          "noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> In
          the Abruzzi water is still supposed to acquire certain marvellous
          and beneficent properties on St. John's Night. They say that on
          that night the sun and moon bathe in the water. Hence many people
          take a bath in the sea or in a river at that season, especially at
          the moment of sunrise. At Castiglione a Casauria they go before
          sunrise to the Pescara River or to springs, wash their faces and
          hands, then gird themselves with twigs of bryony (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vitalba</span></span>) and twine the plant
          round their brows, in order that they may be free from pains. At
          Pescina boys and girls wash each other's faces in a river or a
          spring, then exchange kisses, and become gossips. The dew, also,
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name=
          "Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> falls on St. John's
          Night is supposed in the Abruzzi to benefit whatever it touches,
          whether it be water, flowers, or the human body. For that reason
          people put out vessels of water on the window-sills or the
          terraces, and wash themselves with the water in the morning in
          order to purify themselves and escape headaches and colds. A still
          more efficacious mode of accomplishing the same end is to rise at
          the peep of dawn, to wet the hands in the dewy grass, and then to
          rub the moisture on the eyelids, the brow, and the temples, because
          the dew is believed to cure maladies of the head and eyes. It is
          also a remedy for diseases of the skin. Persons who are thus
          afflicted should roll on the dewy grass. When patients are
          prevented by their infirmity or any other cause from quitting the
          house, their friends will gather the dew in sheets or tablecloths
          and so apply it to the suffering part.<a id="noteref_730" name=

          Marsala in Sicily there is a spring of water in a subterranean
          grotto called the Grotto of the Sibyl. Beside it stands a church of
          St. John, which has been supposed to occupy the site of a temple of
          Apollo. On St. John's Eve, the twenty-third of June, women and
          girls visit the grotto, and by drinking of the prophetic water
          learn whether their husbands have been faithful to them in the year
          that is past, or whether they themselves will wed in the year that
          is to come. Sick people, too, imagine that by bathing in the water,
          drinking of it, or ducking thrice in it in the name of the Trinity,
          they will be made whole.<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731"

          Chiaramonte in Sicily the following custom is observed on St.
          John's Eve. The men repair to one fountain and the women to
          another, and dip their heads thrice in the water, repeating at each
          ablution certain verses in honour of St. John. They believe that
          this is a cure or preventive of the scald.<a id="noteref_732" name=

          was nearly setting, and his host at once led him to the Rhine. A
          strange sight there met his eyes, for the banks of the river were
          covered with pretty women. The crowd was great but good-humoured.
          From a rising ground on which he stood the poet saw many of the
          women, girt with fragrant herbs, kneel down on the water's edge,
          roll their sleeves up above their elbows, and wash their white arms
          and hands in the river, murmuring softly some words which the
          Italian did not understand. He was told that the custom was a very
          old one, much honoured in the observance; for the common folk,
          especially the women, believed that to wash in the river on St.
          John's Eve would avert every misfortune in the coming year.<a id=

          roll in the dew on the morning of St. John's Day is also esteemed a
          cure for diseases of the skin in Normandy and Perigord. In Perigord
          a field of hemp is especially recommended for the purpose, and the
          patient should rub himself with the plants on which he has

          Ciotat in Provence, while the midsummer bonfire blazed, young
          people used to plunge into the sea and splash each other
          vigorously. At Vitrolles they bathed in a pond in order that they
          might not suffer from fever during the year, and at Saint-Maries

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may perhaps
          be suggested that this wide-spread custom of bathing in water or
          dew on Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day is purely Christian in
          origin, having been adopted as an appropriate mode of celebrating
          the day dedicated to the Baptist. But in point of fact the custom
          is older than Christianity, for it was denounced and forbidden as a
          heathen practice by Augustine,<a id="noteref_740" name=
          "noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class=

          may conjecture that the Church, unable to put down this relic of
          paganism, followed its usual policy of accommodation by bestowing
          on the rite of a Christian name and acquiescing, with a sigh, in
          its observance. And casting about for a saint to supplant a heathen
          patron of bathing, the Christian doctors could hardly have hit upon
          a more appropriate successor than St. John the Baptist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But into whose
          shoes did the Baptist step? Was the displaced deity really Adonis,
          as the foregoing evidence seems to suggest? In Sardinia and Sicily
          it may have been so, for in these islands Semitic influence was
          certainly deep and probably lasting. The midsummer pastimes of
          Sardinian and Sicilian children may therefore be a direct
          continuation of the Carthaginian rites of Tammuz. Yet the midsummer
          festival seems too widely spread and too deeply rooted in Central
          and Northern Europe to allow us to trace it everywhere to an
          Oriental origin in general and to the cult of Adonis in particular.
          It has the air of a native of the soil rather than of an exotic
          imported from the East. We shall <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> do better, therefore, to suppose that at a
          remote period similar modes of thought, based on similar needs, led
          men independently in many distant lands, from the North Sea to the
          Euphrates, to celebrate the summer solstice with rites which, while
          they differed in some things, yet agreed closely in others; that in
          historical times a wave of Oriental influence, starting perhaps
          from Babylonia, carried the Tammuz or Adonis form of the festival
          westward till it met with native forms of a similar festival; and
          that under pressure of the Roman civilization these different yet
          kindred festivals fused with each other and crystallized into a
          variety of shapes, which subsisted more or less separately side by
          side, till the Church, unable to suppress them altogether, stripped
          them so far as it could of their grosser features, and dexterously
          changing the names allowed them to pass muster as Christian. And
          what has just been said of the midsummer festivals probably
          applies, with the necessary modifications, to the spring festivals
          also. They, too, seem to have originated independently in Europe
          and the East, and after ages of separation to have amalgamated
          under the sway of the Roman Empire and the Christian Church. In
          Syria, as we have seen, there appears to have been a vernal
          celebration of Adonis; and we shall presently meet with an
          undoubted instance of an Oriental festival of spring in the rites
          of Attis. Meantime we must return for a little to the midsummer
          festival which goes by the name of St. John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sardinian
          practice of making merry round a great bonfire on St. John's Eve is
          an instance of a custom which has been practised at the midsummer

          instances which I have cited in other parts of this work seem to
          indicate a connexion of the midsummer bonfire with vegetation. For
          example, both in Sweden and Bohemia an essential part of the
          festival is the raising of a May-pole or Midsummer-tree, which in
          Bohemia is burned in the bonfire.<a id="noteref_743" name=

          Kupalo is here represented in duplicate, in tree-form by the
          Midsummer-tree, and in human form by the straw effigy, just as
          Adonis was represented both by an image and a garden of Adonis; and
          the duplicate representatives of Kupalo, like those of Adonis, are
          finally cast into water. In the Sardinian and Sicilian customs the
          Gossips or Sweethearts of St. John probably answer, on the one hand
          to Adonis and Astarte, on the other to the King and Queen of May.
          In the Swedish province of Blekinge part of the midsummer festival
          is the election of a Midsummer Bride, who chooses her bridegroom; a
          collection is made for the pair, who for the time being are looked
          upon as man and wife.<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href=

          Midsummer pairs may be supposed, like the May pairs, to stand for
          the powers of vegetation or of fertility in general: they represent
          in flesh and blood what the images of Siva or Mahadeo and Parvati
          in the Indian ceremonies, and the images of Adonis and Aphrodite in
          the Alexandrian ceremony, set forth in effigy.</p>

          ceremonies whose aim is to foster the growth of vegetation should
          thus be associated with bonfires; why in particular the
          representative of vegetation should be burned in the likeness of a
          tree, or passed across the fire in effigy or in the form of a
          living couple, has been discussed by me elsewhere.<a id=

          it is enough to have adduced evidence of such association, and
          therefore to have obviated the objection which might have been
          raised to my theory of the Sardinian custom, on the ground that the
          bonfires have nothing to do with vegetation. One more piece of
          evidence may here be given to prove the contrary. In some parts of
          Germany and Austria young men and girls leap over midsummer
          bonfires for the express purpose of making the hemp or flax grow
          tall.<a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a> We
          may, therefore, assume that in the Sardinian custom the blades of
          wheat and barley which are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> forced on in pots for the midsummer festival,
          and which correspond so closely to the gardens of Adonis, form one
          of those widely-spread midsummer ceremonies, the original object of
          which was to promote the growth of vegetation, and especially of
          the crops. But as, by an easy extension of ideas, the spirit of
          vegetation was believed to exercise a beneficent and fertilizing
          influence on human as well as animal life, the gardens of Adonis
          would be supposed, like the May-trees or May-boughs, to bring good
          luck, and more particularly perhaps offspring,<a id="noteref_748"
          name="noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> to
          the family or to the person who planted them; and even after the
          idea had been abandoned that they operated actively to confer
          prosperity, they might still be used to furnish omens of good or
          evil. It is thus that magic dwindles into divination. Accordingly
          we find modes of divination practised at midsummer which resemble
          more or less closely the gardens of Adonis. Thus an anonymous
          Italian writer of the sixteenth century has recorded that it was
          customary to sow barley and wheat a few days before the festival of
          St. John (Midsummer Day) and also before that of St. Vitus; and it
          was believed that the person for whom they were sown would be
          fortunate, and get a good husband or a good wife, if the grain
          sprouted well; but if it sprouted ill, he or she would be
          unlucky.<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href=
          "#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> In
          various parts of Italy and all over Sicily it is still customary to
          put plants in water or in earth on the Eve of St. John, and from
          the manner in which they are found to be blooming or fading on St.
          John's Day omens are drawn, especially as to fortune in love.
          Amongst the plants used for this purpose are <span lang="it" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="it"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ciuri di S. Giuvanni</span></span> (St. John's
          wort?) and nettles.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href=
          "#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> In
          Prussia two hundred years ago the farmers used to send out their
          servants, especially their maids, to gather St. John's <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> wort on Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day
          (St. John's Day). When they had fetched it, the farmer took as many
          plants as there were persons and stuck them in the wall or between
          the beams; and it was thought that he or she whose plant did not
          bloom would soon fall sick or die. The rest of the plants were tied
          in a bundle, fastened to the end of a pole, and set up at the gate
          or wherever the corn would be brought in at the next harvest. The
          bundle was called <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kupole</span></span>: the
          ceremony was known as Kupole's festival; and at it the farmer
          prayed for a good crop of hay, and so forth.<a id="noteref_751"
          name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> This
          Prussian custom is particularly notable, inasmuch as it strongly
          confirms the opinion that Kupalo (doubtless identical with Kupole)
          was originally a deity of vegetation.<a id="noteref_752" name=
          "noteref_752" href="#note_752"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> For
          here Kupalo is represented by a bundle of plants specially
          associated with midsummer in folk-custom; and her influence over
          vegetation is plainly signified by placing her vegetable emblem
          over the place where the harvest is brought in, as well as by the
          prayers for a good crop which are uttered on the occasion. This
          furnishes a fresh argument in support of the view that the Death,
          whose analogy to Kupalo, Yarilo, and the rest I have shown
          elsewhere, originally personified vegetation, more especially the
          dying or dead vegetation of winter.<a id="noteref_753" name=

          Further, my interpretation of the gardens of Adonis is confirmed by
          finding that in this Prussian custom the very same kind of plants
          is used to form the gardens of Adonis (as we may call them) and the
          image of the deity. Nothing could set in a stronger light the truth
          of the theory that the gardens of Adonis are merely another
          manifestation of the god himself.</p>

          gardens of Adonis are still sown in spring as well as in summer,

          the approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, and
          canary-seed in plates, which they keep in the dark and water every
          two days. The plants soon shoot up; the stalks are tied together

          perhaps in other places. The whole custom—sepulchres as well as

          into the street on a bier adorned with lemons, roses, jessamine,
          and other flowers, and there begins a grand procession of the

          through the whole town. Every man carries his taper and breaks out
          into doleful lamentation. At all the houses which the procession
          passes there are seated women with censers to fumigate the marching

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In like manner
          the Catholic Church has been accustomed to bring before its
          followers in a visible form the death and resurrection of the
          Redeemer. Such sacred dramas are well fitted to impress the lively
          imagination and to stir the warm feelings of a susceptible southern
          race, to whom the pomp and pageantry of Catholicism are more
          congenial than to the colder temperament of the Teutonic peoples.
          The solemnities observed in Sicily on Good Friday, the official
          anniversary of the Crucifixion, are thus described by a native
          Sicilian writer. <span class="tei tei-q">“A truly moving ceremony
          is the procession which always takes place in the evening in every
          commune of Sicily, and further the Deposition from the Cross. The
          brotherhoods took part in the procession, and the rear was brought
          up by a great many boys and girls representing saints, both male
          and female, and carrying the emblems of Christ's Passion. The
          Deposition from the Cross was managed by the priests. The coffin
          with the dead Christ in it was flanked by Jews armed with swords,
          an object of horror and aversion in the midst of the profound pity
          excited by the sight not only of Christ but of the Mater Dolorosa,
          who followed behind him. Now and then the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘mysteries’</span> or symbols of the Crucifixion went
          in front. Sometimes the procession followed the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘three hours of agony’</span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Deposition from the Cross.’</span> The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘three hours’</span> commemorated those which Jesus
          Christ passed upon the Cross. Beginning at the eighteenth and
          ending at the twenty-first hour of Italian time two priests
          preached alternately on the Passion. Anciently the sermons were
          delivered in the open air on the place called the Calvary: at last,
          when the third hour was about to strike, at the words <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">emisit
          spiritum</span></span> Christ died, bowing his head amid the sobs
          and tears of the bystanders. Immediately afterwards in some places,
          three hours afterwards in others, the sacred body was unnailed and
          deposited in the coffin. In Castronuovo, at the Ave Maria, two
          priests clad as Jews, representing Joseph of Arimathea and
          Nicodemus, with their servants in costume, repaired to the Calvary,
          preceded by the Company of the Whites. There, with doleful verses
          and chants appropriate to the occasion, they performed the various
          operations of the Deposition, after which the procession took its
          way to the larger church.... In Salaparuta the Calvary is erected
          in the church. At the preaching of the death, the Crucified is made
          to bow his head by means of machinery, while guns are fired,
          trumpets sound, and amid the silence of the people, impressed by
          the death of the Redeemer, the strains of a melancholy funeral
          march are heard. Christ is removed from the Cross and deposited in
          the coffin by three priests. After the procession of the dead
          Christ the burial is performed, that is, two priests lay Christ in
          a fictitious sepulchre, from which at the mass of Easter Saturday
          the image of the risen Christ issues and is elevated upon the altar
          by means of machinery.”</span><a id="noteref_758" name=

          how often the Church has skilfully contrived to plant the seeds of
          the new faith on the old stock of paganism, we may surmise that the
          Easter celebration of the dead and risen Christ was grafted upon a
          similar celebration of the dead and risen Adonis, which, as we have
          seen reason to believe, was celebrated in Syria at the same season.
          The type, created by Greek artists, of the sorrowful goddess with
          her dying lover in her arms, resembles and may have <span class=

          Virgin with the dead body of her divine Son in her lap, of which
          the most celebrated example is the one by Michael Angelo in St.
          Peter's. That noble group, in which the living sorrow of the mother
          contrasts so wonderfully with the languor of death in the son, is
          one of the finest compositions in marble. Ancient Greek art has
          bequeathed to us few works so beautiful, and none so

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          connexion a well-known statement of Jerome may not be without
          significance. He tells us that Bethlehem, the traditionary
          birthplace of the Lord, was shaded by a grove of that still older
          Syrian Lord, Adonis, and that where the infant Jesus had wept, the
          lover of Venus was bewailed.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762"

          Though he does not expressly say so, Jerome seems to have thought
          that the grove of Adonis had been planted by the heathen after the
          birth of Christ for the purpose of defiling the sacred spot. In
          this he may have been mistaken. If Adonis was indeed, as I have
          argued, the spirit of the corn, a more suitable name for his
          dwelling-place could hardly be found than Bethlehem, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the House of Bread,”</span><a id="noteref_763" name=
          "noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> and
          he may well have been worshipped there at his House of Bread long
          ages before the birth of Him who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          am the bread of life.”</span><a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764"
          href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> Even
          on the hypothesis that Adonis followed rather than preceded Christ
          at Bethlehem, the choice of his sad figure to divert the allegiance
          of Christians from their Lord cannot but strike us as eminently
          appropriate when we remember the similarity of the rites which
          commemorated the death and resurrection of the two. One of the
          earliest seats of the worship of the new god was Antioch, and at
          Antioch, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
          258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as we have seen,<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href=
          "#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> the
          death of the old god was annually celebrated with great solemnity.
          A circumstance which attended the entrance of Julian into the city
          at the time of the Adonis festival may perhaps throw some light on
          the date of its celebration. When the emperor drew near to the city
          he was received with public prayers as if he had been a god, and he
          marvelled at the voices of a great multitude who cried that the
          Star of Salvation had dawned upon them in the East.<a id=
          "noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href="#note_766"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a> This
          may doubtless have been no more than a fulsome compliment paid by
          an obsequious Oriental crowd to the Roman emperor. But it is also
          possible that the rising of a bright star regularly gave the signal
          for the festival, and that as chance would have it the star emerged
          above the rim of the eastern horizon at the very moment of the
          emperor's approach. The coincidence, if it happened, could hardly
          fail to strike the imagination of a superstitious and excited
          multitude, who might thereupon hail the great man as the deity
          whose coming was announced by the sign in the heavens. Or the
          emperor may have mistaken for a greeting to himself the shouts
          which were addressed to the star. Now Astarte, the divine mistress
          of Adonis, was identified with the planet Venus, and her changes
          from a morning to an evening star were carefully noted by the
          Babylonian astronomers, who drew omens from her alternate
          appearance and disappearance.<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767"
          href="#note_767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> Hence
          we may conjecture that the festival of Adonis was regularly timed
          to coincide with the appearance of Venus as <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Morning or Evening Star. But the
          star which the people of Antioch saluted at the festival was seen
          in the East; therefore, if it was indeed Venus, it can only have
          been the Morning Star. At Aphaca in Syria, where there was a famous
          temple of Astarte, the signal for the celebration of the rites was
          apparently given by the flashing of a meteor, which on a certain
          day fell like a star from the top of Mount Lebanon into the river
          Adonis. The meteor was thought to be Astarte herself,<a id=
          "noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="#note_768"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> and
          its flight through the air might naturally be interpreted as the
          descent of the amorous goddess to the arms of her lover. At Antioch
          and elsewhere the appearance of the Morning Star on the day of the
          festival may in like manner have been hailed as the coming of the
          goddess of love to wake her dead leman from his earthy bed. If that
          were so, we may surmise that it was the Morning Star which guided
          the wise men of the East to Bethlehem,<a id="noteref_769" name=

          hallowed spot which heard, in the language of Jerome, the weeping
          of the infant Christ and the lament for Adonis.</p>

          Phrygian cosmogony an almond figured <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          perhaps because its delicate lilac blossom is one of the first
          heralds of the spring, appearing on the bare boughs before the
          leaves have opened. Such tales of virgin mothers are relics of an
          age of childish ignorance when men had not yet recognized the
          intercourse of the sexes as the true cause of offspring. That
          ignorance, still shared by the lowest of existing savages, the
          aboriginal tribes of central Australia,<a id="noteref_775" name=

          doubtless at one time universal among mankind. Even in later times,
          when people are better acquainted with the laws of nature, they
          sometimes imagine that these laws may be subject to exceptions, and
          that miraculous beings may be born in miraculous ways by women who
          have never known a man. In Palestine to this day it is believed
          that a woman may conceive by a jinnee or by the spirit of her dead
          husband. There is, or was lately, a man at Nebk who is currently
          supposed to be the offspring of such a union, and the simple folk
          have never suspected his mother's virtue.<a id="noteref_776" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> Two
          different accounts of the death of Attis were current. According to
          the one he was killed by a boar, like Adonis. According to the
          other he unmanned himself under a pine-tree, and bled to death on
          the spot. The latter is said to have been the local story told by
          the people of Pessinus, a great seat of the worship of Cybele, and
          the whole legend of which the story forms a part is stamped with a
          character of rudeness and savagery that speaks strongly for its
          antiquity.<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href=
          "#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a> Both
          tales might claim the support of custom, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> or rather both were probably invented to
          explain certain customs observed by the worshippers. The story of
          the self-mutilation of Attis is clearly an attempt to account for
          the self-mutilation of his priests, who regularly castrated
          themselves on entering the service of the goddess. The story of his
          death by the boar may have been told to explain why his
          worshippers, especially the people of Pessinus, abstained from
          eating swine.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href=

          conveyed to Rome, where it was received with great respect and

          little images suspended on their breasts, appear to have been a

          procession, carrying the image of the goddess and chanting their
          hymns to the music of cymbals and tambourines, flutes and horns,

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a> The
          third day, the twenty-fourth of March, was known as the Day of
          Blood: the Archigallus or high-priest drew blood from his arms and
          presented it as an offering.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789"
          href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> Nor
          was he alone in making this bloody sacrifice. Stirred by the wild
          barbaric music of clashing cymbals, rumbling drums, droning horns,
          and screaming flutes, the inferior clergy whirled about in the
          dance with waggling heads and streaming hair, until, rapt into a
          frenzy of excitement and insensible to pain, they gashed their
          bodies with potsherds or slashed them with knives in order to
          bespatter the altar and the sacred tree with their flowing
          blood.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href=
          "#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> The
          ghastly rite probably formed part of the mourning for Attis and may
          have been intended to strengthen him for the resurrection. The
          Australian aborigines cut themselves in like manner over the graves
          of their friends for the purpose, perhaps, of enabling them to be
          born again.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href=

          Further, we may conjecture, though we are not expressly told, that
          it was on the same Day of Blood and for the same purpose that the
          novices sacrificed their virility. Wrought up to the highest pitch
          of religious excitement they dashed the severed portions of
          themselves against the image of the cruel goddess. These broken
          instruments of fertility were afterwards reverently wrapt up and
          buried in the earth or in subterranean chambers sacred to
          Cybele,<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href=
          "#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          where, like the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
          269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          offering of blood, they may have been deemed instrumental in
          recalling Attis to life and hastening the general resurrection of
          nature, which was then bursting into leaf and blossom in the vernal
          sunshine. Some confirmation of this conjecture is furnished by the
          savage story that the mother of Attis conceived by putting in her
          bosom a pomegranate sprung from the severed genitals of a
          man-monster named Agdestis, a sort of double of Attis.<a id=

          truth in this conjectural explanation of the custom, we can readily
          understand why other Asiatic goddesses of fertility were served in
          like manner by eunuch priests. These feminine deities required to
          receive from their male ministers, who personated the divine
          lovers, the means of discharging their beneficent functions: they
          had themselves to be impregnated by the life-giving energy before
          they could transmit it to the world. Goddesses thus ministered to
          by eunuch priests were the great Artemis of Ephesus<a id=

          sanctuary, frequented by swarms of pilgrims and enriched by the
          offerings of Assyria and Babylonia, of Arabia and Phoenicia, was
          perhaps in the days of its glory the most popular in the

          the unsexed priests of this Syrian goddess resembled those of

          the mode in which they dedicated themselves to the religious life
          was similar. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg
          270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          greatest festival of the year at Hierapolis fell at the beginning
          of spring, when multitudes thronged to the sanctuary from Syria and
          the regions round about. While the flutes played, the drums beat,
          and the eunuch priests slashed themselves with knives, the
          religious excitement gradually spread like a wave among the crowd
          of onlookers, and many a one did that which he little thought to do
          when he came as a holiday spectator to the festival. For man after
          man, his veins throbbing with the music, his eyes fascinated by the
          sight of the streaming blood, flung his garments from him, leaped
          forth with a shout, and seizing one of the swords which stood ready
          for the purpose, castrated himself on the spot. Then he ran through
          the city, holding the bloody pieces in his hand, till he threw them
          into one of the houses which he passed in his mad career. The
          household thus honoured had to furnish him with a suit of female
          attire and female ornaments, which he wore for the rest of his
          life.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href=

          the tumult of emotion had subsided, and the man had come to himself
          again, the irrevocable sacrifice must often have been followed by
          passionate sorrow and lifelong regret. This revulsion of natural
          human feeling after the frenzies of a fanatical religion is
          powerfully depicted by Catullus in a celebrated poem.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The parallel of
          these Syrian devotees confirms the view that in the similar worship
          of Cybele the sacrifice of virility took place on the Day of Blood
          at the vernal rites of the goddess, when the violets, supposed to
          spring from the red drops of her wounded lover, were in bloom among
          the pines. Indeed the story that Attis unmanned himself under a
          pine-tree<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href=
          "#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          clearly devised to explain why his priests did the same beside the

          "tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> At all events, we can hardly doubt that
          the Day of Blood witnessed the mourning for Attis over an effigy of
          him which was afterwards buried.<a id="noteref_801" name=
          "noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class=

          Throughout the period of mourning the worshippers fasted from
          bread, nominally because Cybele had done so in her grief for the
          death of Attis,<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href=

          partake of bread or flour at such a season might have been deemed a
          wanton profanation of the bruised and broken body of the god. Or
          the fast may possibly have been a preparation for a sacramental

          about the streets in disguise. No dignity was too high or too
          sacred for the humblest citizen to assume with impunity. In the
          reign of Commodus a band of conspirators thought to take advantage
          of the masquerade by dressing in the uniform of the Imperial Guard,
          and so, mingling with the crowd of merrymakers, to get within
          stabbing distance of the emperor. But the plot miscarried.<a id=

          Finally, the Roman festival closed on the twenty-seventh of March
          with a procession to the brook Almo. The silver image of the
          goddess, with its face of jagged black stone, sat in a wagon drawn
          by oxen. Preceded by the nobles walking barefoot, it moved slowly,
          to the loud music of pipes and tambourines, out by the Porta
          Capena, and so down to the banks of the Almo, which flows into the
          Tiber just below the walls of Rome. There the high-priest, robed in
          purple, washed the wagon, the image, and the other sacred objects
          in the water of the stream. On returning from their bath, the wain
          and the oxen were strewn with fresh spring flowers. All was mirth
          and gaiety. No one thought of the blood that had flowed so lately.
          Even the eunuch priests forgot their wounds.<a id="noteref_810"

          ceremonies, which probably aimed at bringing the worshipper, and
          especially the novice, into closer communication with his god. Our
          information as to the nature of these mysteries and the date of
          their celebration is unfortunately very scanty, but they seem to
          have included a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood. In the
          sacrament the novice became a partaker of the mysteries by eating
          out of a drum and drinking out of a cymbal, two instruments of

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The original
          character of Attis as a tree-spirit is brought out plainly by the
          part which the pine-tree plays in his legend, his ritual, and his
          monuments.<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href=
          "#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a> The
          story that he was a human being transformed into a pine-tree is
          only one of those transparent attempts at rationalizing old beliefs
          which meet us so frequently in mythology. The bringing in of the
          pine-tree from the woods, decked with violets and woollen bands, is
          like bringing in the May-tree or Summer-tree in modern folk-custom;
          and the effigy which was attached to the pine-tree was only a
          duplicate representative of the tree-spirit Attis. After being
          fastened to the tree, the effigy was kept for a year and then
          burned.<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href=
          "#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a> The
          same thing appears to have been sometimes done with the May-pole;
          and in like manner the effigy of the corn-spirit, made at harvest,
          is often preserved till it is replaced by a new effigy at next
          year's harvest.<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href=
          "#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> The
          original intention of such customs was no doubt to maintain the
          spirit of vegetation in life throughout the year. Why the Phrygians
          should have worshipped the pine above other trees we can only
          guess. Perhaps the sight of its changeless, though sombre, green
          cresting the ridges of the high hills above the fading splendour of
          the autumn woods in the valleys may have seemed to their eyes to
          mark it out as the seat of a diviner life, of something exempt from
          the sad vicissitudes of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> seasons, constant and eternal as the sky
          which stooped to meet it. For the same reason, perhaps, ivy was
          sacred to Attis; at all events, we read that his eunuch priests
          were tattooed with a pattern of ivy leaves.<a id="noteref_823"
          name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a>
          Another reason for the sanctity of the pine may have been its
          usefulness. The cones of the stone-pine contain edible nut-like
          seeds, which have been used as food since antiquity, and are still
          eaten, for example, by the poorer classes in Rome.<a id=
          "noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a>
          Moreover, a wine was brewed from these seeds,<a id="noteref_825"
          name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> and
          this may partly account for the orgiastic nature of the rites of
          Cybele, which the ancients compared to those of Dionysus.<a id=
          "noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a>
          Further, pine-cones were regarded as symbols or rather instruments
          of fertility. Hence at the festival of the Thesmophoria they were
          thrown, along with pigs and other agents or emblems of fecundity,
          into the sacred vaults of Demeter for the purpose of quickening the
          ground and the wombs of women.<a id="noteref_827" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like
          tree-spirits in general, Attis was apparently thought to wield
          power over the fruits of the earth or even to be identical with the
          corn. One of his epithets was <span class="tei tei-q">“very
          fruitful”</span>: he was addressed as the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn”</span>; and the
          story of his sufferings, death, and resurrection was interpreted as
          the ripe grain wounded by the reaper, buried in the granary, and
          coming to life again when it is sown in the ground.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a> A
          statue of him in the Lateran Museum at Rome clearly indicates his
          relation to the fruits of the earth, and particularly to the corn;
          for it represents him with a bunch of ears of corn and fruit in his
          hand, and a wreath of pine-cones, pomegranates, and other fruits on
          his head, while from the top of his Phrygian cap ears of corn are
          sprouting.<a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href=

          stone urn, which contained the ashes of an Archigallus or
          high-priest of Attis, the same idea is expressed in a slightly
          different way. The top of the urn is adorned with ears of corn
          carved in relief, and it is surmounted by the figure of a cock,
          whose tail consists of ears of corn.<a id="noteref_830" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a>
          Cybele in like manner was conceived as a goddess of fertility who
          could make or mar the fruits of the earth; for the people of
          Augustodunum (Autun) in Gaul used to cart her image about in a
          wagon for the good of the fields and vineyards, while they danced
          and sang before it,<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href=
          "#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> and
          we have seen that in Italy an unusually <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> fine harvest was attributed to the recent
          arrival of the Great Mother.<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> The
          bathing of the image of the goddess in a river may well have been a
          rain-charm to ensure an abundant supply of moisture for the crops.
          Or perhaps, as Mr. Hepding has suggested, the union of Cybele and
          Attis, like that of Aphrodite and Adonis, was dramatically
          represented at the festival, and the subsequent bath of the goddess
          was a ceremonial purification of the bride, such as is often
          observed at human marriages.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833"
          href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> In
          like manner Aphrodite is said to have bathed after her union with

          every year she recovered her virginity by bathing in the spring of

          However that may be, the rules of diet observed by the worshippers
          of Cybele and Attis at their solemn fasts are clearly dictated by a
          belief that the divine life of these deities manifested itself in
          the fruits of the earth, and especially in such of them as are
          actually hidden by the soil. For while the devotees were allowed to
          partake of flesh, though not of pork or fish, they were forbidden
          to eat seeds and the roots of vegetables, but they might eat the
          stalks and upper parts of the plants.<a id="noteref_838" name=

          her character does not rest on a perverse and mischievous theory
          that virginity is more honourable than matrimony. It is derived, as
          I have already indicated, from a state of savagery in which the
          mere fact of paternity was unknown. That explains why in later
          times, long after the true nature of paternity had been
          ascertained, the Father God was often a much less important
          personage in mythology than his divine partner the Mother Goddess.
          With regard to Attis in his paternal character it deserves to be
          noticed that the Bithynians used to ascend to the tops of the
          mountains and there call upon him under the name of Papas. The
          custom is attested by Arrian,<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845"
          href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> who
          as a native of Bithynia must have had good opportunities of
          observing it. We may perhaps infer from it that the Bithynians
          conceived Attis as a sky-god or heavenly father, like Zeus, with
          whom indeed Arrian identifies him. If that were so, the story of
          the loves of Attis and Cybele, the Father God and the Mother
          Goddess, might be in one of its aspects a particular version of the
          widespread myth which represents Mother Earth fertilized by Father
          Sky;<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href=

          further, the story of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg
          283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          emasculation of Attis would be parallel to the Greek legend that
          Cronus castrated his father, the old sky-god Uranus,<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> and
          was himself in turn castrated by his own son, the younger sky-god
          Zeus.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href=
          "#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> The
          tale of the mutilation of the sky-god by his son has been plausibly
          explained as a myth of the violent separation of the earth and sky,
          which some races, for example the Polynesians, suppose to have
          originally clasped each other in a close embrace.<a id=
          "noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> Yet
          it seems unlikely that an order of eunuch priests like the Galli
          should have been based on a purely cosmogonic myth: why should they
          continue for all time to be mutilated because the sky-god was so in
          the beginning? The custom of castration must surely have been
          designed to meet a constantly recurring need, not merely to reflect
          a mythical event which happened at the creation of the world. Such
          a need is the maintenance of the fruitfulness of the earth,
          annually imperilled by the changes of the seasons. Yet <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the theory that the mutilation of the
          priests of Attis and the burial of the severed parts were designed
          to fertilize the ground may perhaps be reconciled with the
          cosmogonic myth if we remember the old opinion, held apparently by
          many peoples, that the creation of the world is year by year
          repeated in that great transformation which depends ultimately on
          the annual increase of the sun's heat.<a id="noteref_850" name=

          However, the evidence for the celestial aspect of Attis is too
          slight to allow us to speak with any confidence on this subject. A
          trace of that aspect appears to survive in the star-spangled cap
          which he is said to have received from Cybele,<a id="noteref_851"

          Perhaps we may go a step farther and conjecture that this mimic
          killing of the priest, accompanied by a real effusion of his blood,
          was in Phrygia, as it has been elsewhere, a substitute for a human
          sacrifice which in earlier times was actually offered. Sir W. M.
          Ramsay, whose authority on all questions relating to Phrygia no one
          will dispute, is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg

          of opinion that at these Phrygian ceremonies <span class=

          year by a cruel death, just as the god himself died.”</span><a id=

          the priests of Pessinus were at one time potentates as well as
          priests; they may, therefore, have belonged to that class of divine
          kings or popes whose duty it was to die each year for their people
          and the world. The name of Attis, it is true, does not occur among
          the names of the old kings of Phrygia, who seem to have borne the
          names of Midas and Gordias in alternate generations; but a very
          ancient inscription carved in the rock above a famous Phrygian
          monument, which is known as the Tomb of Midas, records that the
          monument was made for, or dedicated to, King Midas by a certain
          Ates, whose name is doubtless identical with Attis, and who, if not
          a king himself, may have been one of the royal family.<a id=

          worthy of note also that the name Atys, which, again, appears to be

          that a son of Croesus, king of Lydia, not only bore the name Atys
          but was said to have been killed, while he was hunting a boar, by a
          member of the royal Phrygian family, who traced his lineage to King
          Midas and had fled to the court of Croesus because he had

          Scholars have recognized in this story of the death of Atys, son of
          Croesus, a mere double of the myth of Attis;<a id="noteref_863"

          in view of the facts which have come before us in the present
          inquiry<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href=
          "#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is a remarkable
          circumstance that the myth of a slain god should be told of a
          king's son. May we conjecture that the Phrygian priests who bore
          the name of Attis and represented the god of that name were
          themselves members, perhaps the eldest sons, of the royal house, to
          whom their fathers, uncles, brothers, or other kinsmen deputed the
          honour of dying a violent death in the character of gods, while
          they reserved to themselves the duty of living, as long as nature
          allowed them, in the humbler character of kings? If this were so,
          the Phrygian dynasty of Midas may have presented a close parallel
          to the Greek dynasty of Athamas, in which the eldest sons seem to
          have been regularly destined to the altar.<a id="noteref_865" name=
          "noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> But
          it is also possible that the divine priests who bore the name of
          Attis may have belonged to that indigenous race which the
          Phrygians, on their irruption into Asia from Europe, appear to have
          found and conquered in the land afterwards known as Phrygia.<a id=
          "noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> On
          the latter hypothesis the priests may have represented an older and
          higher civilization than that of their barbarous conquerors. Be
          that as it may, the god they personated was a deity of vegetation
          whose divine life manifested itself especially in the pine-tree and
          the violets of spring; and if they died in the character of that
          divinity, they corresponded to the mummers who are still slain in
          mimicry by European peasants in spring, and to the priest who was
          slain long ago in grim earnest on the wooded shore of the Lake of
          Nemi.</p>

          barbarous custom was afterwards mitigated into the form in which it
          is known to us in later times, when the priest merely drew blood

          strung up to a tree or a gallows and then wounded with a spear.
          Hence Odin was called the Lord of the Gallows or the God of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bagobos of
          Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, used annually to sacrifice
          human victims for the good of the crops in a similar way. Early in
          December, when the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
          291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          constellation Orion appeared at seven o'clock in the evening, the
          people knew that the time had come to clear their fields for sowing
          and to sacrifice a slave. The sacrifice was presented to certain
          powerful spirits as payment for the good year which the people had
          enjoyed, and to ensure the favour of the spirits for the coming
          season. The victim was led to a great tree in the forest; there he
          was tied with his back to the tree and his arms stretched high
          above his head, in the attitude in which ancient artists portrayed
          Marsyas hanging on the fatal tree. While he thus hung by the arms,
          he was slain by a spear thrust through his body at the level of the
          armpits. Afterwards the body was cut clean through the middle at
          the waist, and the upper part was apparently allowed to dangle for
          a little from the tree, while the under part wallowed in blood on
          the ground. The two portions were finally cast into a shallow
          trench beside the tree. Before this was done, anybody who wished
          might cut off a piece of flesh or a lock of hair from the corpse
          and carry it to the grave of some relation whose body was being
          consumed by a ghoul. Attracted by the fresh corpse, the ghoul would
          leave the mouldering old body in peace. These sacrifices have been
          offered by men now living.<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877"

          Indeed a trace of a similar rite may perhaps be detected even at
          Ephesus, the most famous of her sanctuaries, in the legend of a
          woman who hanged herself and was thereupon dressed by the
          compassionate goddess in her own divine garb and called by the name
          of Hecate.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href=

          Similarly, at Melite in Phthia, a story <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> was told of a girl named Aspalis who hanged
          herself, but who appears to have been merely a form of Artemis. For
          after her death her body could not be found, but an image of her
          was discovered standing beside the image of Artemis, and the people
          bestowed on it the title of Hecaerge or Far-shooter, one of the
          regular epithets of the goddess. Every year the virgins sacrificed
          a young goat to the image by hanging it, because Astypalis was said
          to have hanged herself.<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href=

          sacrifice may have been a substitute for hanging an image or a
          human representative of Artemis. Again, in Rhodes the fair Helen
          was worshipped under the title of Helen of the Tree, because the
          queen of the island had caused her handmaids, disguised as Furies,
          to string her up to a bough.<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881"

          the Asiatic Greeks sacrificed animals in this fashion is proved by

          the animal's back.<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href=

          that Marsyas was flayed and that his skin was exhibited at Celaenae

          of effecting his resurrection, and with it the revival of
          vegetation in spring. Similarly, in ancient Mexico the human

          was heaped up over the grave. A year afterwards fifty of his
          servants and fifty of his best horses were strangled; and their
          bodies, having been disembowelled and cleaned out, were stuffed
          with chaff, sewn up, and set on scaffolds round about the barrow,

          noble Mongol died, the custom was to bury him seated in the middle
          of a tent, along with a horse saddled and bridled, and a mare and
          her foal. Also they used to eat another horse, stuff the carcase
          with straw, and set it up on poles. All this they did in order that
          in the other world the dead man might have a tent to live in, a
          mare to yield milk, and a steed to ride, and that he might be able
          to breed horses. Moreover, the bones of the horse which they ate

          he witnessed the funeral of an emperor of China who had been killed
          in battle. The dead sovereign was buried along with four young
          female slaves and six guards in a vault, and an immense mound like
          a hill was piled over him. Four horses were then made to run round
          the hillock till they could run no longer, after which they were
          killed, impaled, and set up beside the tomb.<a id="noteref_887"

          turned towards the grave. At the funeral of a chief four horses are
          sacrificed, and one is set up at each corner of the burial-place.

          if my conjecture is right, the man who represented the father-god
          of Phrygia used to be slain and his stuffed skin hung on the sacred
          pine in order that his spirit might work for the growth of the
          crops, the multiplication of animals, and the fertility of women.
          So at Athens an ox, which appears to have embodied the corn-spirit,
          was killed at an annual sacrifice, and its hide, stuffed with straw
          and sewn up, was afterwards set on its feet and yoked to a plough
          as if it were ploughing, apparently in order to represent, or
          rather to promote, the resurrection of the slain <span class=

          and Roman society was built on the conception of the subordination
          of the individual to the community, of the citizen to the state; it
          set the safety of the commonwealth, as the supreme aim of conduct,
          above the safety of the individual whether in this world or in a
          world to come. Trained from infancy in this unselfish ideal, the
          citizens devoted their lives to the public service and were ready
          to lay them down for the common good; or if they shrank from the
          supreme sacrifice, it never occurred to them that they acted
          otherwise than basely in preferring their personal existence to the
          interests of their country. All this was changed by the spread of
          Oriental religions which inculcated the communion of the soul with
          God and its eternal salvation as the only objects worth living for,
          objects in comparison with which the prosperity and even the
          existence of the state sank into insignificance. The inevitable
          result of this selfish and immoral doctrine was to withdraw the
          devotee more and more from the public service, to concentrate his
          thoughts on his own spiritual emotions, and to breed in him a
          contempt for the present life which he regarded merely as a
          probation for a better and an eternal. The saint and the recluse,
          disdainful of earth and rapt in ecstatic contemplation of heaven,
          became in popular opinion the highest ideal of humanity, displacing
          the old ideal of the patriot and hero who, forgetful of self, lives
          and is ready to die for the good of his country. The earthly city
          seemed poor and contemptible to men whose eyes beheld the City of
          God coming in the clouds of heaven. Thus the centre of gravity, so
          to say, was shifted from the present to a future life, and however
          much the other world may have gained, there can be little doubt
          that this one lost heavily by the change. A general disintegration
          of the body politic set in. The ties of the state and the family
          were loosened: the structure of society tended to resolve itself
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name=
          "Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into its individual
          elements and thereby to relapse into barbarism; for civilization is
          only possible through the active co-operation of the citizens and
          their willingness to subordinate their private interests to the
          common good. Men refused to defend their country and even to
          continue their kind.<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href=

          their anxiety to save their own souls and the souls of others, they
          were content to leave the material world, which they identified
          with the principle of evil, to perish around them. This obsession
          lasted for a thousand years. The revival of Roman law, of the
          Aristotelian philosophy, of ancient art and literature at the close
          of the Middle Ages, marked the return of Europe to native ideals of
          life and conduct, to saner, manlier views of the world. The long
          halt in the march of civilization was over. The tide of Oriental

          of the universe, and to adjust his little life to its awful
          mysteries. However that may be, there can be no doubt that the

          ritual of the nativity, as it appears to have been celebrated in
          Syria and Egypt, was remarkable. The celebrants retired into
          certain inner shrines, from which at midnight they issued with a
          loud cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Virgin has brought forth!

          Gospels say nothing as to the day of Christ's birth, and
          accordingly the early Church did not celebrate it. In time,
          however, the Christians of Egypt came to regard the sixth of
          January as the date of the Nativity, and the custom of
          commemorating the birth of the Saviour on that day gradually spread
          until by the fourth century it was universally established in the
          East. But at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth
          century the Western Church, which had never recognized the sixth of
          January as the day of the Nativity, adopted the twenty-fifth of
          December as the true date, and in time its decision was accepted
          also by the Eastern Church. At Antioch the change was not
          introduced till about the year 375 <span class=

          kindled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
          305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and festivities
          the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the
          Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this
          festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity
          should be solemnized on that day and the festival of the Epiphany
          on the sixth of January. Accordingly, along with this custom, the
          practice has prevailed of kindling fires till the
          sixth.”</span><a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href=

          heathen origin of Christmas is plainly hinted at, if not tacitly
          admitted, by Augustine when he exhorts his Christian brethren not
          to celebrate that solemn day like the heathen on account of the
          sun, but on account of him who made the sun.<a id="noteref_922"

          that the Christian Church chose to celebrate the birthday of its

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the conjecture that motives of the
          same sort may have led the ecclesiastical authorities to assimilate
          the Easter festival of the death and resurrection of their Lord to
          the festival of the death and resurrection of another Asiatic god
          which fell at the same season. Now the Easter rites still observed
          in Greece, Sicily, and Southern Italy bear in some respects a
          striking resemblance to the rites of Adonis, and I have suggested
          that the Church may have consciously adapted the new festival to
          its heathen predecessor for the sake of winning souls to
          Christ.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href=

          this adaptation probably took place in the Greek-speaking rather
          than in the Latin-speaking parts of the ancient world; for the
          worship of Adonis, while it flourished among the Greeks, appears to
          have made little impression on Rome and the West.<a id=

          Certainly it never formed part of the official Roman religion. The
          place which it might have taken in the affections of the vulgar was
          already occupied by the similar but more barbarous worship of Attis
          and the Great Mother. Now the death and resurrection of Attis were
          officially celebrated at Rome on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth
          of March,<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href=

          therefore as the most appropriate day for the revival of a god of
          vegetation who had been dead or sleeping throughout the winter. But
          according to an ancient and widespread tradition Christ suffered on
          the twenty-fifth of March, and accordingly some Christians
          regularly celebrated the Crucifixion on that day without any regard
          to the state of the moon. This custom was certainly observed in
          Phrygia, Cappadocia, and Gaul, and there seem to be grounds for
          thinking that at one time it was followed also in Rome.<a id=

          placed the death of Christ on the twenty-fifth of March was ancient
          and deeply rooted. It is all the more remarkable because

          inference appears to be inevitable that the passion of Christ must
          have been arbitrarily referred to that date in order to harmonize
          with an older festival of the spring equinox. This is the view of
          the learned ecclesiastical historian Mgr. Duchesne, who points out
          that the death of the Saviour was thus made to fall upon the very
          day on which, according to a widespread belief, the world had been

          Attis at the vernal equinox.<a id="noteref_938" name="noteref_938"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At least it is a
          remarkable coincidence, if it is nothing more, that the Christian
          and the heathen festivals of the divine death and resurrection
          should have been solemnized at the same season and in the same
          places. For the places which celebrated the death of Christ at the
          spring equinox were Phrygia, Gaul, and apparently Rome, that is,
          the very regions in which the worship of Attis either originated or
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name=
          "Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> struck deepest root.
          It is difficult to regard the coincidence as purely accidental. If
          the vernal equinox, the season at which in the temperate regions
          the whole face of nature testifies to a fresh outburst of vital
          energy, had been viewed from of old as the time when the world was
          annually created afresh in the resurrection of a god, nothing could
          be more natural than to place the resurrection of the new deity at
          the same cardinal point of the year. Only it is to be observed that
          if the death of Christ was dated on the twenty-fifth of March, his
          resurrection, according to Christian tradition, must have happened
          on the twenty-seventh of March, which is just two days later than
          the vernal equinox of the Julian calendar and the resurrection of
          Attis. A similar displacement of two days in the adjustment of
          Christian to heathen celebrations occurs in the festivals of St.
          George and the Assumption of the Virgin. However, another Christian
          tradition, followed by Lactantius and perhaps by the practice of
          the Church in Gaul, placed the death of Christ on the twenty-third
          and his resurrection on the twenty-fifth of March.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In point of fact
          it appears from the testimony of an anonymous Christian, who wrote
          in the fourth century of our era, that Christians and pagans alike
          were struck by the remarkable coincidence between the death and
          resurrection of their respective deities, and that the coincidence
          formed a theme of bitter controversy between the adherents of the
          rival religions, the pagans contending that the resurrection of
          Christ was a spurious imitation of the resurrection of Attis, and
          the Christians asserting with equal warmth that the resurrection of
          Attis was a diabolical counterfeit of the resurrection of Christ.
          In these unseemly bickerings the heathen took what to a superficial
          observer might seem strong ground by arguing that their god was the
          older and therefore presumably the original, not the counterfeit,
          since as a general rule an original is older than its copy. This
          feeble argument the Christians easily rebutted. They <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> admitted, indeed, that in point of time
          Christ was the junior deity, but they triumphantly demonstrated his
          real seniority by falling back on the subtlety of Satan, who on so
          important an occasion had surpassed himself by inverting the usual
          order of nature.<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href=

          altogether, the coincidences of the Christian with the heathen
          festivals are too close and too numerous to be accidental. They
          mark the compromise which the Church in the hour of its triumph was
          compelled to make with its vanquished yet still dangerous rivals.
          The inflexible Protestantism of the primitive missionaries, with
          their fiery denunciations of heathendom, had been exchanged for the
          supple policy, the easy tolerance, the comprehensive charity of
          shrewd ecclesiastics, who clearly perceived that if Christianity
          was to conquer the world it could do so only by relaxing the too
          rigid principles of its Founder, by widening a little the narrow
          gate which leads to salvation. In this respect an instructive
          parallel might be drawn between the history of Christianity and the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name=

          systems were in their origin essentially ethical reforms born of
          the generous ardour, the lofty aspirations, the tender compassion
          of their noble Founders, two of those beautiful spirits who appear

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> Both
          preached moral virtue as the means of accomplishing what they
          regarded as the supreme object of life, the eternal salvation of
          the individual soul, though by a curious antithesis the one sought
          that salvation in a blissful eternity, the other in a final release
          from suffering, in annihilation. But the austere ideals of sanctity
          which they inculcated were too deeply opposed not only to the
          frailties but to the natural instincts of humanity ever to be
          carried out in practice by more than a small number of disciples,
          who consistently renounced the ties of the family and the state in
          order to work out their own salvation in the still seclusion of the
          cloister. If such faiths were to be nominally accepted by whole
          nations or even by the world, it was essential that they should
          first be modified or transformed so as to accord in some measure
          with the prejudices, the passions, the superstitions of the vulgar.
          This process of accommodation was carried out in after ages by
          followers who, made of less ethereal stuff than their masters, were
          for that reason the better fitted to mediate between them and the
          common herd. Thus as time went on, the two religions, in exact
          proportion to their growing popularity, absorbed more and more of
          those baser elements which they had been instituted for the very
          purpose of suppressing. Such spiritual decadences are <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> inevitable. The world cannot live at
          the level of its great men. Yet it would be unfair to the
          generality of our kind to ascribe wholly to their intellectual and
          moral weakness the gradual divergence of Buddhism and Christianity
          from their primitive patterns. For it should never be forgotten
          that by their glorification of poverty and celibacy both these
          religions struck straight at the root not merely of civil society
          but of human existence. The blow was parried by the wisdom or the
          folly of the vast majority of mankind, who refused to purchase a
          chance of saving their souls with the certainty of extinguishing
          the species.</p>

          of him may not be out of place in the present discussion. According
          to the legend, Hyacinth was the youngest and handsomest son of the
          ancient king Amyclas, who had his capital at Amyclae in the
          beautiful vale of Sparta. One day playing at quoits with Apollo, he
          was accidentally killed by a blow of the god's quoit. Bitterly the
          god lamented the death of his friend. The hyacinth—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that sanguine flower inscribed with woe”</span>—sprang
          from the blood of the hapless youth, as anemones and roses from the
          blood of Adonis, and violets from the blood of Attis:<a id=
          "noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="#note_944"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a> like
          these vernal flowers it heralded the advent of another spring and
          gladdened the hearts of men with the promise of a joyful
          resurrection. The flower is usually supposed to be not what we call
          a hyacinth, but a little purple iris with the letters of
          lamentation (AI, which in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg

          Greek means <span class="tei tei-q">“alas”</span>) clearly
          inscribed in black on its petals. In Greece it blooms in spring
          after the early violets but before the roses.<a id="noteref_945"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a> One
          spring, when the hyacinths were in bloom, it happened that the
          red-coated Spartan regiments lay encamped under the walls of
          Corinth. Their commander gave the Amyclean battalion leave to go
          home and celebrate as usual the festival of Hyacinth in their
          native town. But the sad flower was to be to these men an omen of
          death; for they had not gone far before they were enveloped by
          clouds of light-armed foes and cut to pieces.<a id="noteref_946"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tomb of
          Hyacinth was at Amyclae under a massive altar-like pedestal, which
          supported an archaic bronze image of Apollo. In the left side of
          the pedestal was a bronze door, and through it offerings were
          passed to Hyacinth, as to a hero or a dead man, not as to a god,
          before sacrifices were offered to Apollo at the annual Hyacinthian
          festival. Bas-reliefs carved on the pedestal represented Hyacinth
          and his maiden sister Polyboea caught up to heaven by a company of
          goddesses.<a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href=

          annual festival of the Hyacinthia was held in the month of
          Hecatombeus, which seems to have corresponded to May.<a id=

          wreaths, singing no paeans, eating no bread, and behaving with
          great gravity. It was on this day probably that the offerings were
          made at Hyacinth's tomb. Next day the scene was changed. All was
          joy and bustle. The capital was emptied of its inhabitants, who
          poured out in their thousands to witness and share the festivities
          at Amyclae. Boys in high-girt tunics sang hymns in honour of the
          god to the accompaniment of flutes and lyres. Others, splendidly
          attired, paraded on horseback in the theatre: choirs of youths
          chanted their native ditties: dancers danced: maidens rode in
          wicker carriages or went in procession to witness the chariot
          races: sacrifices were offered in profusion: the citizens feasted
          their friends and even their slaves.<a id="noteref_949" name=

          outburst of gaiety may be supposed to have celebrated the
          resurrection of Hyacinth and perhaps also his ascension to heaven,
          which, as we have seen, was represented on his tomb. However, it
          may be that the ascension took place on the third day of the
          festival; but as to that we know nothing. The sister who went to
          heaven with him was by some identified with Artemis or
          Persephone.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href=

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Hyacinth an aboriginal god,

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is highly
          probable, as Erwin Rohde perceived,<a id="noteref_951" name=
          "noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> that
          Hyacinth was an old aboriginal deity of the underworld who had been
          worshipped at Amyclae long before the Dorians invaded and conquered
          the country. If that was so, the story of his relation to Apollo
          must have been a comparatively late invention, an attempt of the
          newcomers to fit the ancient god of the land into their own
          mythical system, in order that he might extend his protection to
          them. On this theory it may not be without significance
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name=
          "Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that sacrifices at
          the festival were offered to Hyacinth, as to a hero, before they
          were offered to Apollo.<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href=
          "#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>
          Further, on the analogy of similar deities elsewhere, we should
          expect to find Hyacinth coupled, not with a male friend, but with a
          female consort. That consort may perhaps be detected in his sister
          Polyboea, who ascended to heaven with him. The new myth, if new it
          was, of the love of Apollo for Hyacinth would involve a changed
          conception of the aboriginal god, which in its turn must have
          affected that of his spouse. For when Hyacinth came to be thought
          of as young and unmarried there was no longer room in his story for
          a wife, and she would have to be disposed of in some other way.
          What was easier for the myth-maker than to turn her into his
          unmarried sister? However we may explain it, a change seems
          certainly to have come over the popular idea of Hyacinth; for
          whereas on his tomb he was portrayed as a bearded man, later art
          represented him as the pink of youthful beauty.<a id="noteref_953"
          name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> But
          it is perhaps needless to suppose that the sisterly relation of
          Polyboea to him was a late modification of the myth. The stories of
          Cronus and Rhea, of Zeus and Hera, of Osiris and Isis, remind us
          that in old days gods, like kings, often married their sisters, and
          probably for the same reason, namely, to ensure their own title to
          the throne under a rule of female kinship which treated women and
          not men as the channel in which the blood royal flowed.<a id=
          "noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> It is
          not impossible that Hyacinth may have been a divine king who
          actually reigned in his lifetime at Amyclae and was afterwards
          worshipped at his tomb. The representation of his triumphal ascent
          to heaven in company with his sister suggests that, like Adonis and
          Persephone, he may have been supposed to spend one part of the year
          in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
          317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          under-world of darkness and death, and another part in the
          upper-world of light and life. And as the anemones and the
          sprouting corn marked the return of Adonis and Persephone, so the
          flowers to which he gave his name may have heralded the ascension
          of Hyacinth.</p>

          concerned with the beliefs and practices of Orientals I may quote
          the following passage from one who has lived long in the East and
          knows it well: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Oriental mind is free
          from the trammels of logic. It is a literal fact that the Oriental
          mind can accept and believe two opposite things at the same time.
          We find fully qualified and even learned Indian doctors practising
          Greek medicine, as well as English medicine, and enforcing sanitary
          restrictions to which their own houses and families are entirely
          strangers. We find astronomers who can predict eclipses, and yet
          who believe that eclipses are caused by a dragon swallowing the
          sun. We find holy men who are credited with miraculous powers and
          with close communion with the Deity, who live in drunkenness and
          immorality, and who are capable of elaborate frauds on others. To
          the Oriental mind, a thing must be incredible to command a ready
          belief”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“Riots and Unrest in the

          the people of the Lower Congo, an experienced missionary describes
          their religious ideas as <span class="tei tei-q">“chaotic in the
          extreme and impossible to reduce to any systematic order. The same
          person will tell you at different times that the departed spirit

          to the sun. There is no coherence in their beliefs, and their ideas
          about cosmogony and the future are very nebulous. Although they
          believe in punishment after death their faith is so hazy that it
          has lost all its deterrent force. If in the following pages a lack
          of logical unity is observed, it must be put to the debit of the

          The gradual desiccation of Central Asia, which is conjectured to
          have caused the Sumerian migration, has been similarly invoked to
          explain the downfall of the Roman empire; for by rendering great
          regions uninhabitable it is supposed to have driven hordes of
          fierce barbarians to find new homes in Europe. See Professor J. W.
          Gregory's lecture <span class="tei tei-q">“Is the earth drying
          up?”</span> delivered before the Royal Geographical Society and
          reported in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          It is held by Prof. Hommel (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>)
          that the Sumerian language belongs to the Ural-altaic family, but
          the better opinion seems to be that its linguistic affinities are
          unknown. The view, once ardently advocated, that Sumerian was not a
          language but merely a cabalistic mode of writing Semitic, is now
          generally exploded.</dd>

          According to Jerome (on Ezekiel viii. 14) the month of Tammuz was
          June; but according to modern scholars it corresponded rather to
          July, or to part of June and part of July. See F. C. Movers,

          Robertson Smith informed me that owing to the variations of the
          local Syrian calendars the month of Tammuz fell in different places
          at different times, from midsummer to autumn, or from June to
          September. According to Prof. M. Jastrow, the festival of Tammuz
          was celebrated just before the summer solstice (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Religion of
          Babylonia and Assyria</span></span>, pp. 547, 682). He observes
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the calendar of the Jewish Church
          still marks the 17th day of Tammuz as a fast, and Houtsma has shown
          that the association of the day with the capture of Jerusalem by
          the Romans represents merely the attempt to give an ancient
          festival a worthier interpretation.”</span></dd>

          This seems to indicate that in Edom, as elsewhere, the blood royal
          was traced in the female line, and that the kings were men of other
          families, or even foreigners, who succeeded to the throne by
          marrying the hereditary princesses. See <span class=

          The Israelites were forbidden to have a foreigner for a king
          (Deuteronomy xvii. 15 with S. R. Driver's note), which seems to
          imply that the custom was known among their neighbours. It is
          significant that some of the names of the kings of Edom seem to be
          those of divinities, as Prof. A. H. Sayce observed long ago

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Professor A. H. Sayce has argued that
          David's original name was Elhanan (2 Samuel xxi. 19 compared with
          xxiii. 24), and that the name David, which he took at a later time,
          should be written Dod or Dodo, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Beloved
          One,”</span> which according to Prof. Sayce was a name for Tammuz
          (Adonis) in Southern Canaan, and was in particular bestowed by the
          Jebusites of Jerusalem on their supreme deity. See A. H. Sayce,

          on the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians</span></span> (London

          would accord perfectly with those which I had reached
          independently, and it would become probable that David only assumed
          the name of David (Dod, Dodo) after the conquest of Jerusalem, and
          for the purpose of identifying himself with the god of the city,
          who had borne the same title from time immemorial. But on the whole
          it seems more likely, as Professor Kennett points out to me, that
          in the original story Elhanah, a totally different person from
          David, was the slayer of Goliath, and that the part of the
          giant-killer was thrust on David at a later time when the

          sister? Professor T. K. Cheyne supposes that she was Astarte, and
          by a very slight change (דדה for הדה) he would read <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dodah”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“his
          glory,”</span> thus restoring the balance between the clauses; for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dodah”</span> would then answer to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Adon”</span> (lord) as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sister”</span> answers to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“brother.”</span> I have to thank Professor Cheyne for
          kindly communicating this conjecture to me by letter. He writes
          that Dodah <span class="tei tei-q">“is a title of Ishtar, just as
          Dôd is a title of Tamûz,”</span> and for evidence he refers me to
          the Dodah of the Moabite Stone, where, however, the reading Dodah

          Why hair oil should be considered a vehicle of inspiration is by no
          means clear. It would have been intelligible if the olive had been
          with the Hebrews, as it was with the Athenians, a sacred tree under
          the immediate protection of a deity; for then a portion of the
          divine essence might be thought to reside in the oil. W. Robertson
          Smith supposed that the unction was originally performed with the
          fat of a sacrificial victim, for which vegetable oil was a later
          substitute (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          this passage, contrary to his usual practice, the Chronicler has
          enlivened the dull tenor of his history with some picturesque
          touches which we miss in the corresponding passage of Kings. It is
          to him that we owe the vision of the Angel of the Plague first
          stretching out his sword over Jerusalem and then returning it to
          the scabbard. From him Defoe seems to have taken a hint in his
          account of the prodigies, real or imaginary, which heralded the
          outbreak of the Great Plague in London. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“One time before the plague was begun, otherwise than
          as I have said in St. Giles's, I think it was in March, seeing a
          crowd of people in the street, I joined with them to satisfy my
          curiosity, and found them all staring up into the air to see what a
          woman told them appeared plain to her, which was an angel clothed
          in white with a fiery sword in his hand, waving it or brandishing
          it over his head.... One saw one thing and one another. I looked as
          earnestly as the rest, but, perhaps, not with so much willingness
          to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing
          but a white cloud, bright on one side, by the shining of the sun
          upon the other part.”</span> See Daniel Defoe, <span class=

          Among the trees which line the valley are oak, sycamore, bay,

          Robinson writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no spot in all
          my wanderings on which memory lingers with greater delight than on
          the sequestered retreat and exceeding loveliness of Afka.”</span>
          Renan says that the landscape is one of the most beautiful in the
          world. My friend the late Sir Francis Galton wrote to me (20th
          September 1906): <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no good map of
          Palestine, but strongly suspect that my wanderings there, quite
          sixty years ago, took me to the place you mention, above the gorge
          of the river Adonis. Be that as it may, I have constantly asserted
          that the view I then had of a deep ravine and blue sea seen through
          the cliffs that bounded it, was the most beautiful I had ever set
          eyes on.”</span></dd>

          there was a remarkable necklace of green stones and gold in the

          identified it with the necklace of Harmonia or Eriphyle. A

          her wearing a necklace which she touches with one hand. See L. P.

          The scanty ruins of Amathus occupy an isolated hill beside the sea.

          Eusebius. As he was born and spent his life in Syria, and was a
          contemporary of the practices he describes, the bishop of Caesarea
          had the best opportunity of informing himself as to them, and we
          ought not, as Prof. M. P. Nilsson does (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Griechische
          Feste</span></span>, Leipsic, 1906, p. 366 n.<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>),
          to allow his positive testimony on this point to be outweighed by
          the silence of the later historian Sozomenus, who wrote long after
          the custom had been abolished. Eusebius had good reason to know the
          heathenish customs which were kept up in his diocese; for he was
          sharply taken to task by Constantine for allowing sacrifices to be
          offered on altars under the sacred oak or terebinth at Mamre; and
          in obedience to the imperial commands he caused the altars to be
          destroyed and an oratory to be built instead under the tree. So in
          Ireland the ancient heathen sanctuaries under the sacred oaks were
          converted by Christian missionaries into churches and monasteries.

          at the disposal of any foreigners who came to lodge with them, and
          deemed it an honour if the guests made use of their opportunities.
          The emperor, hearing of the custom, forbade the people to observe
          it. For three years they obeyed, then, finding that their lands
          were no longer fruitful and that many mishaps befell them, they
          prayed the emperor to allow them to retain the custom, <span class=

          regard their conduct as very natural. The administrative authority
          having bestirred itself and attempted to regulate this

          kingdom from a dissolute monarch named Pasicyprus some time before
          the conquests of Alexander (Athenaeus, iv. 63, p. 167). In this

          succeeded by his eldest son is proved by the case of Solomon, who
          on his accession executed his elder brother Adoni-jah (1 Kings ii.
          22-24). Similarly, when Abimelech became king of Shechem, he put
          his seventy brothers in ruthless oriental fashion to death. See
          Judges viii. 29-31, ix. 5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Jehoram, King of Judah, put all his brothers to the sword (2
          Chronicles xxi. 4). King Rehoboam had eighty-eight children (2
          Chronicles xi. 21) and King Abi-jah had thirty-eight (2 Chronicles
          xiii. 21). These examples illustrate the possible size of the
          family of a polygamous king.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“priests and priestesses are readily

          hair long and unkempt, while other people, except the women in the
          towns on the seaboard, have it cut close to the head.... Frequently
          both appear with white circles painted round their eyes, or with
          various white devices, marks, or lines painted on the face, neck,
          shoulders, or arms”</span> (A. B. Ellis, <span class=

          some very elaborate, and an expert can tell by the marks on a
          priest to what god he is vowed, and what rank he holds in the
          order. These hierarchical marks consist of lines, scrolls,
          diamonds, and other patterns, with sometimes a figure, such as that
          of the crocodile or chameleon. The shoulders are frequently seen
          covered with an infinite number of small marks like dots, set close

          the prophet's shoulders are especially marked is perhaps given by
          the statement of a Zulu that <span class="tei tei-q">“the sensitive
          part with a doctor [medicine-man] is his shoulders. Everything he
          feels is in the situation of his shoulders. That is the place where

          the badge of a Hebrew prophet were marks tattooed on his shoulders
          in token of his holy office. The suggestion is confirmed by the
          prophet's own statement (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          from village to village, performing tricks, living on alms, and
          enjoying certain social and domestic privileges, which very often
          lead to scandalous scenes. Some of these men are mad, some are
          fanatics, but the majority are, I imagine, rogues. They are
          reverenced not only by the peasantry, but also sometimes by the
          governing class. I have seen the Kady of Nazareth ostentatiously
          preparing food for a miserable and filthy beggar, who sat in the
          justice-hall, and was consulted as if he had been inspired. A
          Derwîsh of peculiar eminence is often dressed in good clothes, with
          a spotless turban, and is preceded by a banner-bearer, and followed
          by a band, with drum, cymbal, and tambourine.... It is natural to
          reflect whether the social position of the Prophets among the Jews
          may not have resembled that of the Derwîshes.”</span></dd>

          friend Mr. Roscoe tells me that serpents are revered and fed with
          milk by the Banyoro to the north of Uganda; but he cannot say
          whether the creatures are supposed to be incarnations of the dead.
          Some of the Gallas also regard serpents as sacred and offer milk to
          them, but it is not said that they believe the reptiles to embody
          the souls of the departed. See Rev. J. L. Krapf, <span class=

          with the corresponding text in vol. i. (where the eccentric system
          of paging adopted renders references to it practically useless). In
          these groups the female figure is commonly, and perhaps correctly,
          interpreted as the Goddess of Health (Hygieia). It is to be
          remembered that Hygieia was deemed a daughter of the serpent-god
          Aesculapius (Pausanias i. 23. 4), and was constantly associated
          with him in ritual and art. See, for example, Pausanias, i. 40. 6,
          ii. 4. 5, ii. 11. 6, ii. 23. 4, ii. 27. 6, iii. 22. 13, v. 20. 3,

          47. 1. The snake-entwined goddess whose image was found in a
          prehistoric shrine at Gournia in Crete may have been a predecessor
          of the serpent-feeding Hygieia. See R. M. Burrows, <span class=

          snakes, which were the regular symbol of the Furies, may have been
          originally nothing but the emblems or rather embodiments of the
          dead; and the Furies themselves may, like Aesculapius, have been
          developed out of the reptiles, sloughing off their serpent skins
          through the anthropomorphic tendency of Greek thought.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span> As to this Melanesian
          belief that animals can enter into women and be born from them as
          human children with animal characteristics, Dr. Rivers observes (p.
          174): <span class="tei tei-q">“It was clear that this belief was
          not accompanied by any ignorance of the physical <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> of the human father, and
          that the father played the same part in conception as in cases of
          birth unaccompanied by an animal appearance. We found it impossible
          to get definitely the belief as to the nature of the influence
          exerted by the animal on the woman, but it must be remembered that
          any belief of this kind can hardly have escaped the many years of
          European influence and Christian teaching which the people of this
          group have received. It is doubtful whether even a prolonged
          investigation of this point could now elicit the original belief of
          the people about the nature of the influence.”</span> To me it
          seems that the belief described by Dr. Rivers in the text is
          incompatible with the recognition of human fatherhood as a
          necessary condition for the birth of children, and that though the
          people may now recognize that necessity, perhaps as a result of
          intercourse with Europeans, they certainly cannot have recognized
          it at the time when the belief in question originated.</dd>

          that the natives on the Alligator River in the Northern Territory
          <span class="tei tei-q">“have detailed traditions—as also have all
          the tribes—of how great ancestors wandered over the country leaving
          numbers of spirit children behind them who have been reincarnated
          time after time. They know who everyone is a reincarnation of, as
          the names are perpetuated.”</span></dd>

          socketed stone as a laver rather than as the base of the sacred
          pole. He supposes that the buried infants were first-born children
          sacrificed in accordance with the ancient law of the dedication of
          the first-born. The explanation which I have adopted in the text
          agrees better with the uninjured state of the bodies, and it is
          further confirmed by the result of the Austrian excavations at Tell
          Ta'annek (Taanach) in Palestine, which seem to prove that there
          children up to the age of two years were not buried in the family
          graves but interred separately in jars. Some of these sepulchral
          jars were deposited under or beside the houses, but many were
          grouped round a rock-hewn altar in a different part of the hill.
          There is nothing to indicate that any of the children were
          sacrificed: the size of some of the skeletons precludes the idea
          that they were slain at birth. Probably they all died natural
          deaths, and the custom of burying them in or near the house or
          beside an altar was intended to ensure their rebirth in the family.

          Hamilcar was killed by the Greek cavalry (Diodorus Siculus, xi. 22.

          The native Hittite writing is a system of hieroglyphics which has
          not yet been read, but in their intercourse with foreign nations
          the Hittites used the Babylonian cuneiform script. Clay tablets
          bearing inscriptions both in the Babylonian and in the Hittite
          language have been found by Dr. H. Winckler at Boghaz-Keui, the
          great Hittite capital in Cappadocia; so that the sounds of the
          Hittite words, though not their meanings, are now known. According
          to Professor Ed. Meyer, it seems certain that the Hittite language
          was neither Semitic nor Indo-European. As to the inscribed tablets
          of Boghaz-Keui, see H. Winckler, <span class=

          1, 2. The structure represented on the coins is sometimes called
          not the pyre but the monument of Sandan or Sardanapalus. Certainly
          the cone resting on the square base reminds us of the similar
          structure on the coins of Byblus as well as of the conical image of
          Aphrodite at Paphos (see above, pp. 14, 34); but the words of Dio
          Chrysostom make it probable that the design on the coins of Tarsus
          represents the pyre. At the same time, the burning of the god may
          well have been sculptured on a permanent monument of stone. The
          legend ΟΡΤΥΓΟΘΗΡΑ, literally <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“quail-hunt,”</span> which appears on some coins of
          Tarsus (G. F. Hill, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>), may refer to a custom of
          catching quails and burning them on the pyre. We have seen (above,
          pp. <a href="#Pg111" class="tei tei-ref">111</a> <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>)
          that quails were apparently burnt in sacrifice at Byblus. This
          explanation of the legend on the coins of Tarsus was suggested by
          Raoul-Rochette (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span> pp. 201-205). However,
          Mr. G. F. Hill writes to me that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          interpretation of Ὀρτυγοθήρα as anything but a personal name is
          rendered very unlikely by the analogy of all the other inscriptions
          on coins of the same class.”</span> Doves were burnt on a pyre in
          honour of Adonis (below, p. <a href="#Pg147" class=

            my colleague Professor J. Garstang has kindly furnished me he
            tells me that the two animals wearing Hittite hats, which appear
            between the great god and goddess in the outer sanctuary, are not
            bulls but certainly goats; and he inclines to think that the two
            heaps on which the priest stands in the outer sanctuary are
            fir-cones. Professor Ed. Meyer holds that the costume which the
            priestly king wears is that of the Sun-goddess, and that the
            corresponding figure in the procession of males on the left-hand
            side of the outer sanctuary does not represent the priestly king
            but the Sun-goddess in person. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            attributes of the King,”</span> he says (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
            cit.</span></span> p. 632), <span class="tei tei-q">“are to be
            explained by the circumstance that he, as the Hittite
            inscriptions prove, passed for an incarnation of the Sun, who
            with the Hittites was a female divinity; the temple of the Sun is
            therefore his emblem.”</span> As to the title of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Sun”</span> bestowed on Hittite kings in
            inscriptions, see H. Winckler, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Vorläufige Nachrichten über die Ausgrabungen in
            Boghaz-köi im Sommer 1907,”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mitteilungen der
            Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zu Berlin</span></span>, No. 35,
            December 1907, pp. 32, 33, 36, 44, 45, 53. The correct form of
            the national name appears to be Chatti or Hatti rather than
            Hittites, which is the Hebrew form (חתי) of the name. Compare M.
            Jastrow, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia Biblica</span></span>, ii.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An interesting
            Hittite symbol which occurs both in the sanctuary at Boghaz-Keui
            and at the palace of Euyuk is the double-headed eagle. In both
            places it serves as the support of divine or priestly personages.
            After being adopted as a badge by the Seljuk Sultans in the
            Middle Ages, it passed into Europe with the Crusaders and became
            in time the escutcheon of the Austrian and Russian empires. See

          thus interpreting the Hittite god who heads the procession at
          Boghaz-Keui I follow my colleague Prof. J. Garstang (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Land of the
          Hittites</span></span>, p. 237; <span class=

          Goddess</span></span>, pp. 5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>), who has kindly furnished
          me with some notes on the subject. I formerly interpreted the deity
          as the Hittite equivalent of Tammuz, Adonis, and Attis. But against
          that view it may be urged that (1) the god is bearded and therefore
          of mature age, whereas Tammuz and his fellows were regularly
          conceived as youthful; (2) the thunderbolt which he seems to carry
          would be quite inappropriate to Tammuz, who was not a god of
          thunder but of vegetation; and (3) the Hittite Tammuz is
          appropriately represented in the procession of women immediately
          behind the Mother Goddess (see below, pp. <a href="#Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-ref">137</a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>), and it is extremely
          improbable that he should be represented twice over with different
          attributes in the same scene. These considerations seem to me
          conclusive against the interpretation of the bearded god as a
          Tammuz and decisive in favour of Professor Garstang's view of
          him.</dd>

            lioness or panther represents the lover of the great goddess is
            the view also of Professors Jensen and Hommel. See P. Jensen,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            alten Orients</span></span>, p. 51. Prof. Perrot holds that the
            youth in question is a double of the bearded god who stands at
            the head of the male procession, their costume being the same,
            though their attributes differ (G. Perrot et Ch. Chipiez,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Histoire de l'Art dans
            l'Antiquité</span></span>, iv. 651). But, as I have already
            remarked, it is unlikely that the same god should be represented
            twice over with different attributes in the same scene. The
            resemblance between the two figures is better explained on the
            supposition that they are Father and Son. The same two deities,
            Father and Son, appear to be carved on a rock at Giaour-Kalesi, a
            place on the road which in antiquity may have led from Ancyra by
            Gordium to Pessinus. Here on the face of the rock are cut in
            relief two gigantic figures in the usual Hittite costume of
            pointed cap, short tunic, and shoes turned up at the toes. Each
            wears a crescent-hilted sword at his side, each is marching to
            the spectator's left with raised right hand; and the resemblance
            between them is nearly complete except that the figure in front
            is beardless and the figure behind is bearded. See G. Perrot et

          in the likeness of these animals. But <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          a widespread feature of the primitive social system of Asia Minor;
          their existence is known with certainty or inferred with
          probability at the two towns Komana; at Venasa not far north of
          Tyana, at Olba, at Pessinous, at Aizanoi, and many other places.
          Now there are two characteristics which can be regarded as probable
          in regard to most of these priests, and as proved in regard to some
          of them: (1) they wore the dress and represented the person of the
          god, whose priests they were; (2) they were ἱερώνυμοι, losing their
          individual name at their succession to the office, and assuming a
          sacred name, often that of the god himself or some figure connected
          with the cultus of the god. The priest of Cybele at Pessinous was
          called Attis, the priests of Sabazios were Saboi, the worshippers
          of Bacchos Bacchoi.”</span> As to the priestly rulers of Olba, see

          they were contemporaries of Hadrian. But it is curious to find
          kings of Cyprus reigning so late. Beside the power of the Roman

          sanctuary was revered all over Cappadocia (Strabo, xiv. 2. 5, p.
          537). Prof. Hommel holds that Tarku or Tarchu was the chief Hittite
          deity, worshipped all over the south of Asia Minor. Prof. W. Max
          Müller is of opinion that Targh or Tarkh did not designate any
          particular deity, but was the general Hittite name for <span class=

          slopes of the Taurus. Great destruction is wrought in the forests
          by the roving Yuruks with their flocks; for they light their fires
          under the trees, tap the firs for turpentine, bark the cedars for
          their huts and bee-hives, and lay bare whole tracts of country that

            In the great temple at Hierapolis-Bambyce a mysterious golden
            image stood between the images of Atargatis and her male partner.
            It resembled neither of them, yet combined the attributes of
            other gods. Some interpreted it as Dionysus, others as Deucalion,
            and others as Semiramis; for a golden dove, traditionally
            associated with Semiramis, was perched on the head of the figure.
            The Syrians called the image by a name which Lucian translates
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sign”</span> (σημήιον). See Lucian,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De dea
            Syria</span></span>, 33. It has been plausibly conjectured by F.
            Baethgen that the name which Lucian translates <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sign”</span> was really 'Atheh (עתה), which could
            easily be confused with the Syriac word for <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sign”</span> (אהא). See F. Baethgen, <span class=

            cit.</span></span> p. 73. A coin of Hierapolis, dating from the

            images of the god and goddess seated on bulls and lions
            respectively, with the mysterious object between them enclosed in
            a shrine, which is surmounted by a bird, probably a dove. See J.

          That Hadad was the consort of Atargatis at Hierapolis-Bambyce is
          the opinion of P. Jensen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          who also indicates his character as a god both of thunder and of

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          chief male god of Hierapolis-Bambyce was Hadad is rendered almost
          certain by coins of the city which were struck in the time of
          Alexander the Great by a priestly king Abd-Hadad, whose name means

          F. Hill writes to me that the attribution of these coins to Mallus
          is no longer maintained by any one. Imhoof-Blumer himself now
          conjecturally assigns them to Aphrodisias in Cilicia, and Mr. Hill
          regards this conjecture as very plausible. See F. Imhoof-Blumer,

          Castabala, the situation of which is identified by inscriptions, is

          place the city in Cappadocia, to the north of the Taurus mountains,
          instead of in Cilicia, to the south of them. It is more probable
          that there were two cities of the same name, and that Strabo has
          omitted to mention one of them. Similarly, there were two cities
          called Comana, one in Cappadocia and one in Pontus; at both places
          the same goddess was worshipped with similar rites. See Strabo,

          The site of Magarsus appears to be at Karatash, a hill rising from
          the sea at the southern extremity of the Cilician plain, about
          forty-five miles due south of Adana. The walls of the city, built
          of great limestone blocks, are standing to a height of several
          courses, and an inscription which mentions the priests of Magarsian
          Athena has been found on the spot. See R. Heberdey und A. Wilhelm,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Isaiah xxx. 33. The Revised Version
          has <span class="tei tei-q">“a Topheth”</span> instead of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Tophet.”</span> But Hebrew does not
          possess an indefinite article (the few passages of the Bible in
          which the Aramaic חת is so used are no exception to the rule), and
          there is no evidence that Tophet (Topheth) was ever employed in a
          general sense. The passage of Isaiah has been rightly interpreted
          by W. Robertson Smith in the sense indicated in the text, though he
          denies that it contains any reference to the sacrifice of the

          exhumation by the Philistines, but perhaps rather with a religious
          intention, and almost as an act of worship, since his bones were
          buried under the sacred tamarisk at Jabesh.”</span> In 1 Chronicles
          x. 12 the tree under which the bones of Saul were buried is not a

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">2 Chronicles xvi. 14, xxi. 19;

          Authorized version does in Jeremiah xxxiv. 5, that only spices were
          burned on these occasions; indeed the burning of spices is not
          mentioned at all in any of the three passages. The <span class=

          the apothecaries' art,”</span> which were laid in the dead king's

          to be burned at his funeral. For though <span class=

          dead kings of Judah, there is no evidence (apart from the doubtful
          case of Saul) that their bodies were cremated. They are regularly
          said to have been buried, not burnt. The passage of Isaiah seems to
          show that what was burned at a royal funeral was a great, but
          empty, pyre. That the burnings for the kings formed part of a

          Raoul-Rochette in regard to the deaths both of Sardanapalus and of
          Croesus. He supposed that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Assyrian
          monarch, reduced to the last extremity, wished, by the mode of
          death which he chose, to give to his sacrifice the form of an
          apotheosis and to identify himself with the national god of his
          country by allowing himself to be consumed, like him, on a pyre....
          Thus mythology and history would be combined in a legend in which
          the god and the monarch would finally be confused. There is nothing
          in this which is not conformable to the ideas and habits of Asiatic

          that Croesus burned on a huge pyre the great and costly offerings
          which he dedicated to Apollo at Delphi. He thought, says Herodotus
          (i. 50), that in this way the god would get possession of the

          Mylasa in Caria. The temple was ancient. A road called the Sacred

          of a precipitous mountain, where the marble was quarried.

          music, Thucydides tells us, was not to inspire the men, but to
          enable them to keep step, and so to march in close order. Without
          music a long line of battle was apt to straggle in advancing to the
          charge. As missiles were little used in Greek warfare, there was no
          need to hurry the advance over the intervening ground; so it was
          made deliberately and with the bands playing. The air to which the
          Spartans charged was called Castor's tune. It was the king in
          person who gave the word for the flutes to strike up. See Plutarch,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">I have assumed that the sun shone on
          the Spartans at Thermopylae. For the battle was fought in the
          height of summer, when the Greek sky is generally cloudless, and on
          that particular morning the weather was very still. The evening
          before, the Persians had sent round a body of troops by a difficult
          pass to take the Spartans in the rear; day was breaking when they
          neared the summit, and the first intimation of their approach which
          reached the ears of the Phocian guards posted on the mountain was
          the loud crackling of leaves under their feet in the oak forest.
          Moreover, the famous Spartan saying about fighting in the shade of
          the Persian arrows, which obscured the sun, points to bright, hot
          weather. It was at high noon, and therefore probably in the full
          blaze of the mid-day sun, that the last march-out took place. See

          The temperature of the hot pool varies from 85 to 90 degrees
          Fahrenheit. The volcanic district of Tuscany which skirts the
          Apennines abounds in hot calcareous springs which have produced
          phenomena like those of Hierapolis. Indeed the whole ground is in
          some places coated over with tufa and travertine, which have been
          deposited by the water, and, like the ground at Hierapolis, it
          sounds hollow under the foot. See Sir Ch. Lyell, <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">In the foregoing discussion I have
          confined myself, so far as concerns Asia, to the volcanic regions
          of Cappadocia, Lydia, and Caria. But Syria and Palestine, the home
          of Adonis and Melcarth, <span class="tei tei-q">“abound in volcanic
          appearances, and very extensive areas have been shaken, at
          different periods, with great destruction of cities and loss of
          lives. Continual mention is made in history of the ravages
          committed by earthquakes in Sidon, Tyre, Berytus, Laodicea, and
          Antioch, and in the island of Cyprus. The country around the Dead
          Sea exhibits in some spots layers of sulphur and bitumen, forming a
          superficial deposit, supposed by Mr. Tristram to be of volcanic

          It is said that in the reign of the Emperor Justin the city of
          Antioch was totally destroyed by a dreadful earthquake, in which
          three hundred thousand people perished (Procopius, <span class=

          Persico</span></span>, ii. 14). The destruction of Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Genesis xix. 24-28) has been plausibly explained as the
          effect of an earthquake liberating large quantities of petroleum
          and inflammable gases. See H. B. Tristram, <span class=

          "font-style: italic">De special. legibus</span></span>, i. 183,
          vol. v. p. 44, ed. L. Cohn). On this subject Professor W. M.
          Flinders Petrie writes to me: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Coptic
          calendar puts on April 2 beginning of wheat harvest in Upper Egypt,
          May 2 wheat harvest, Lower Egypt. Barley is two or three weeks
          earlier than wheat in Palestine, but probably less in Egypt. The
          Palestine harvest is about the time of that in North Egypt.”</span>
          With regard to Palestine we are told that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the harvest begins with the barley in April; in the
          valley of the Jordan it begins at the end of March. Between the end
          of the barley harvest and the beginning of the wheat harvest an
          interval of two or three weeks elapses. Thus as a rule the business
          of harvest lasts about seven weeks”</span> (J. Benzinger,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hebräische Archäologie</span></span>, Freiburg
          i. B. and Leipsic, 1894, p. 209). <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          principal grain crops of Palestine are barley, wheat, lentils,
          maize, and millet. Of the latter there is very little, and it is
          all gathered in by the end of May. The maize is then only just
          beginning to shoot. In the hotter parts of the Jordan valley the
          barley harvest is over by the end of March, and throughout the
          country the wheat harvest is at its height at the end of May,
          excepting in the highlands of Galilee, where it is about a
          fortnight later”</span> (H. B. Tristram, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Land of
          Israel</span></span>, Fourth Edition, London, 1882, pp. 583
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>). As to Greece, Professor E.
          A. Gardner tells me that harvest is from April to May in the plains
          and about a month later in the mountains. He adds that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“barley may, then, be assigned to the latter part of
          April, wheat to May in the lower ground, but you know the great
          difference of climate between different parts; there is the same
          difference of a month in the vintage.”</span> Mrs. Hawes (Miss
          Boyd), who excavated at Gournia, tells me that in Crete the barley
          is cut in April and the beginning of May, and that the wheat is cut
          and threshed from about the twentieth of June, though the dates
          naturally vary somewhat with the height of the place above the sea.
          June is also the season when the wheat is threshed in Euboea (R. A.
          Arnold, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">From the Levant</span></span>, London, 1868,
          i. 250). Thus it seems possible that the spring festival of Adonis
          coincided with the cutting of the first barley in March, and his
          summer festival with the threshing of the last wheat in June.
          Father Lagrange (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>)
          argues that the rites of Adonis were always celebrated in summer at
          the solstice of June or soon afterwards. Baudissin also holds that
          the summer celebration is the only one which is clearly attested,
          and that if there was a celebration in spring it must have had a
          different signification than the death of the god. See his

          the grain has sprouted to the height of a few inches.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">That Attis was killed by a boar was

          8. The other story is told by Arnobius (<span class=

          Timotheus, who professed to derive it from recondite antiquarian
          works and from the very heart of the mysteries. It is obviously
          identical with the account which Pausanias (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>)
          mentions as the story current in Pessinus. According to Servius (on
          Virgil, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aen.</span></span> ix. 115), Attis was found
          bleeding to death under a pine-tree, but the wound which robbed him
          of his virility and his life was not inflicted by himself. The
          Timotheus cited by Pausanias may be the Timotheus who was consulted
          by Ptolemy Soter on religious matters and helped to establish the
          worship of Serapis. See Plutarch, <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is held by
            Prof. A. von Domaszewski that the Claudius who incorporated the
            Phrygian worship of the sacred tree in the Roman ritual was not
            the emperor of the first century but the emperor of the third
            century, Claudius Gothicus, who came to the throne in 268
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> See A. von
            Domaszewski, <span class="tei tei-q">“Magna Mater in Latin
            Inscriptions,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Journal of Roman Studies</span></span>,
            i. (1911) p. 56. The later date, it is said, fits better with the
            slow development of the worship. But on the other hand this view
            is open to certain objections. (1) Joannes Lydus, our only
            authority on the point, appears to identify the Claudius in
            question with the emperor of the first century. (2) The great and
            widespread popularity of the Phrygian worship in the Roman empire
            long before 268 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> is amply attested
            by an array of ancient writers and inscriptions, especially by a
            great series of inscriptions referring to the colleges of
            Tree-bearers (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Dendrophori</span></span>),
            from which we learn that one of these colleges, devoted to the
            worship of Cybele and Attis, existed at Rome in the age of the
            Antonines, about a century before the accession of Claudius
            Gothicus. (3) Passages of the Augustan historians (Aelius
            Lampridius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Alexander Severus</span></span>, 37;
            Trebellius Pollio, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Claudius</span></span>, iv. 2) refer to the
            great spring festival of Cybele and Attis in a way which seems to
            imply that the festival was officially recognized by the Roman
            government before Claudius Gothicus succeeded to the purple; and
            we may hesitate to follow Prof. von Domaszewski in simply
            excising these passages as the work of an <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“impudent forger.”</span> (4) The official
            establishment of the bloody Phrygian superstition suits better
            the life and character of the superstitious, timid, cruel,
            pedantic Claudius of the first century than the gallant soldier
            his namesake in the third century. The one lounged away his
            contemptible days in the safety of the palace, surrounded by a
            hedge of lifeguards. The other spent the two years of his brief
            but glorious reign in camps and battlefields on the frontier,
            combating the barbarian enemies of the empire; and it is probable
            that he had as little leisure as inclination to pander to the
            superstitions of the Roman populace. For these reasons it seems
            better with Mr. Hepding and Prof. Cumont to acquiesce in the
            traditional view that the rites of Attis were officially
            celebrated at Rome from the first century onward.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An
            intermediate view is adopted by Prof. G. Wissowa, who, brushing
            aside the statement of Joannes Lydus altogether, would seemingly
            assign the public institution of the rites to the middle of the
            second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> on the ground that
            the earliest extant evidence of their public celebration refers
            to that period (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Religion und Kultus der
            Römer</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "vertical-align: super">2</span></span> Munich, 1912, p. 322).
            But, considering the extremely imperfect evidence at our disposal
            for the history of these centuries, it seems rash to infer that
            an official cult cannot have been older than the earliest notice
            of it which has chanced to come down to us.</p>

          sacrifice the virility of a ram instead of their own. We know from
          inscriptions that rams and bulls were regularly sacrificed at the
          mysteries of Attis and the Great Mother, and that the testicles of
          the bulls were used for a special purpose, probably as a fertility
          charm. May not the testicles of the rams have been employed for the
          same purpose? and may not those of both animals have been

            of his ordinary priests, who bore the name and imitated the
            sufferings of his god. Thus interpreted the poem gains greatly in
            force and pathos. The real sorrows of our fellow-men touch us

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
            sacrifice of virility and the institution of eunuch priests
            appear to be rare, I will add a few examples. At Stratonicea in
            Caria a eunuch held a sacred office in connexion with the worship
            of Zeus and Hecate (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Corpus Inscriptionum
            Graecarum</span></span>, No. 2715). According to Eustathius (on
            Homer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span>, xix. 254, p. 1183) the
            Egyptian priests were eunuchs who had sacrificed their virility
            as a first-fruit to the gods. In Corea <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“during a certain night, known as <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            the palace eunuchs, of whom there are some three hundred, perform
            a ceremony supposed to ensure a bountiful crop in the ensuing
            year. They chant in chorus prayers, swinging burning torches
            around them the while. This is said to be symbolical of burning
            the dead grass, so as to destroy the field mice and other
            vermin.”</span> See W. Woodville Rockhill, <span class=

            Ekoi of Southern Nigeria both men and women are, or used to be,
            mutilated by the excision of their genital organs at an annual
            festival, which is celebrated in order to produce plentiful
            harvests and immunity from thunderbolts. The victims apparently
            die from loss of blood. See P. Amaury Talbot, <span class=

            Southern Nigeria, Feb. 7th, 1913). Amongst the Ba-sundi and
            Ba-bwende of the Congo many youths are castrated <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“in order to more fittingly offer themselves to the
            phallic worship, which increasingly prevails as we advance from
            the coast to the interior. At certain villages between Manyanga
            and Isangila there are curious eunuch dances to celebrate the new
            moon, in which a white cock is thrown up into the air alive, with
            clipped wings, and as it falls towards the ground it is caught
            and plucked by the eunuchs. I was told that originally this used
            to be a human sacrifice, and that a young boy or girl was thrown
            up into the air and torn to pieces by the eunuchs as he or she
            fell, but that of late years slaves had got scarce or manners
            milder, and a white cock was now substituted”</span> (H. H.

            born eunuchs or in some way deformed are sometimes dedicated to a
            goddess named Huligamma. They wear female attire and might be
            mistaken for women. Also men who are or believe themselves
            impotent will vow to dress as women and serve the goddess in the
            hope of recovering their virility. See F. Fawcett, <span class=

            are numerous in this country, are generally chosen, if there are

            mad folks for above half-an-hour; and then some of them fell in
            fits, foaming at the mouth for the space of half-an-hour; and,
            when their senses are restored, they pretend to foretell plenty
            or scarcity of corn for that year, if the year will prove sickly
            or salutary to the people, and several other things of moment,
            and all by that half hour's conversation that the furious dancer
            had with the gods while she was in a trance”</span> (A. Hamilton,

            Archigallus or head of the eunuch priests prophesied; perhaps he
            in like manner worked himself up to the pitch of inspiration by a
            frenzied dance. See H. Dessau, <span class=

          The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">taurobolium</span></span>
          seems to have formed no part of the original worship of Cybele and
          to have been imported into it at a comparatively late date, perhaps
          in the second century of our era. Its origin is obscure. In the
          majority of the older inscriptions the name of the rite appears as
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tauropolium</span></span>, and it has been
          held that this is the true form, being derived from the worship of
          the Asiatic goddess Artemis Tauropolis (Strabo, xii. 2. 7, p. 537).
          This was formerly the view of Prof. F. Cumont (<span class=

          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">taurobolium</span></span>,
          and would deduce both the name and the rite from an ancient
          Anatolian hunting custom of lassoing wild bulls.</dd>

          But the reasons for tabooing apples and dates are not apparent,
          though Julian tried to discover them. He suggested that dates may
          have been forbidden because the date-palm does not grow in Phrygia,
          the native land of Cybele and Attis.</dd>

          which was self-sustaining and self-existent, and was secret and
          unknown, and all-pervading; the more material thinkers, whilst
          admitting that she brought forth her son Rā without the aid of a
          husband, were unable to divorce from their minds the idea that a
          male germ was necessary for its production, and finding it
          impossible to derive it from a being external to the goddess,
          assumed that she herself provided not only the substance which was
          to form the body of Rā but also the male germ which fecundated it.
          Thus Net was the type of partheno-genesis.”</span></dd>

          the Sky, and that their marriage takes place in the rainy season,
          when the rain causes the seeds to sprout and bear fruit. These
          fruits they regard as the children of Mother Earth, who in their

          regions of the Senegal and the Niger it is believed that the
          Sky-god and the Earth-goddess are the parents of the principal
          spirits who dispense life and death, weal and woe, among mankind.
          The eldest son of Sky and Earth is represented in very various
          forms, sometimes as a hermaphrodite, sometimes in semi-animal
          shape, with the head of a bull, a crocodile, a fish, or a serpent.
          His name varies in the different tribes, but the outward form of

          that Osiris mutilated his father Seb at the separation of earth and

          should be solemnly commemorated in an inscription among the

          the other hand, we know that at Nysa the young men did lift and
          carry the sacrificial bull, and that the act was deemed worthy of
          commemoration on the coins. See above, p. <a href="#Pg206" class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Herodotus, iv. 103. Many Scythians
          flayed their dead enemies, and, stretching the skin on a wooden
          framework, carried it about with them on horseback (Herodotus, iv.
          64). The souls of the dead may have been thought to attend on and
          serve the man who thus bore their remains about with him. It is
          also possible that the custom was nothing more than a barbarous
          mode of wreaking vengeance on the dead. Thus a Persian king has
          been known to flay an enemy, stuff the skin with chaff, and hang it
          on a high tree (Procopius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De bello Persico</span></span>, i. 5. 28).
          This was the treatment which the arch-heretic Manichaeus is said to
          have received at the hands of the Persian king whose son he failed
          to cure (Socrates, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Historia Ecclesiastica</span></span>, i. 22;
          Migne's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Patrologia Graeca</span></span>, lxvii. 137,
          139). Still such a punishment may have been suggested by a
          religious rite. The idea of crucifying their human victims appears
          to have been suggested to the negroes of Benin by the crucifixes of
          the early Portuguese missionaries. See H. Ling Roth, <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natives of
            Nias, an island to the west of Sumatra, think it necessary to
            obtain the heads of their enemies for the purpose of celebrating
            the final obsequies of a dead chief. Their notion seems to be
            that the ghost of the deceased ruler demands this sacrifice in
            his honour, and will punish the omission of it by sending
            sickness or other misfortunes on the survivors. Thus among these
            people the custom of head-hunting is based on their belief in
            human immortality and on their conception of the exacting demands
            which the dead make upon the living. When the skulls have been
            presented to a dead chief, the priest prays to him for his
            blessing on the sowing and harvesting of the rice, on the
            fruitfulness of women, and so forth. See C. Fries, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Das <span class="tei tei-q">‘Koppensnellen’</span>
            auf Nias,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Allgemeine
            Missions-Zeitschrift</span></span>, February, 1908, pp. 73-88.
            From this account it would seem that it is not the spirits of the
            slain men, but the ghost of the dead chief from whom the
            blessings of fertility and so forth are supposed to emanate.

          Among the Cameroon negroes accidental homicide can be expiated by
          the blood of an animal. The relations of the slayer and of the
          slain assemble. An animal is killed and every person present is
          smeared with its blood on his face and breast. They think that the
          guilt of manslaughter is thus atoned for, and that no punishment
          will overtake the homicide. See Missionary Autenrieth, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Zur Religion der Kamerun-Neger,”</span> in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> In
          Car Nicobar a man possessed by devils is cleansed of them by being
          rubbed all over with pig's blood and beaten with leaves. The devils
          are thus transferred to the leaves, which are thrown into the sea
          before daybreak. See V. Solomon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Extracts
          from diaries kept in Car Nicobar,”</span> in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal of the
          Anthropological Institute</span></span>, xxxii. (1902) p. 227.
          Similarly the ancient Greeks purified a homicide by means of pig's
          blood and laurel leaves. See my note on Pausanias, ii. 31. 8 (vol.
          iii. pp. 276-279). The original idea of thus purging a manslayer
          was probably to rid him of the angry ghost of his victim, just as
          in Car Nicobar a man is rid of devils in the same manner. The
          purgative virtue ascribed to the blood in these ceremonies may be
          based on the notion that the offended spirit accepts it as a
          substitute for the blood of the guilty person. This was the view of

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">To prevent misapprehension I will add
          that the spread of Oriental religions was only one of many causes
          which contributed to the downfall of ancient civilization. Among
          these contributory causes a friend, for whose judgment and learning
          I entertain the highest respect, counts bad government and a
          ruinous fiscal system, two of the most powerful agents to blast the
          prosperity of nations, as may be seen in our own day by the blight
          which has struck the Turkish empire. It is probable, too, as my
          friend thinks, that the rapid diffusion of alien faiths was as much
          an effect as a cause of widespread intellectual decay. Such
          unwholesome growths could hardly have fastened upon the
          Graeco-Roman mind in the days of its full vigour. We may remember
          the energy with which the Roman Government combated the first
          outbreak of the Bacchic plague (Th. Mommsen, <span class=

          thought that by listening to the words of the inspired prophets the

          series of profane and blasphemous imitations. Among these

          resurrection, and ascension of Dionysus, the virgin birth of

          Christmas has been put forward by Mgr. Duchesne. He shows that
          among the early Christians the death of Christ was commonly
          supposed to have fallen on the twenty-fifth of March, that day
          having been <span class="tei tei-q">“chosen arbitrarily, or rather
          suggested by its coincidence with the official equinox of
          spring.”</span> It would be natural to assume that Christ had lived
          an exact number of years on earth, and therefore that his
          incarnation as well as his death took place on the twenty-fifth of
          March. In point of fact the Church has placed the Annunciation and
          with it the beginning of his mother's pregnancy on that very day.
          If that were so, his birth would in the course of nature have
          occurred nine months later, that is, on the twenty-fifth of
          December. Thus on Mgr. Duchesne's theory the date of the Nativity
          was obtained by inference from the date of the Crucifixion, which
          in its turn was chosen because it coincided with the official
          equinox of spring. Mgr. Duchesne does not notice the coincidence of
          the vernal equinox with the festival of Attis. See his work,

          conception and the death of Christ fell on the twenty-fifth of
          March is mentioned and apparently accepted by Augustine

          learn that there was a gentile as well as a Christian crucifixion
          at the spring equinox. The gentile crucifixion was probably the
          affixing of the effigy of Attis to the tree, though at Rome that
          ceremony appears to have taken place on the twenty-second rather
          than on the twenty-fifth of March. See above, p. 267. The
          Quartodecimans of Phrygia celebrated the twenty-fifth of March as
          the day of Christ's death, quoting as their authority certain acts
          of Pilate; in Cappadocia the adherents of this sect were divided
          between the twenty-fifth of March and the fourteenth of the moon.
          See Epiphanius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Adversus Haeres.</span></span> l. 1 (vol. ii.

          Graeca</span></span>, xli. 884 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>).
          In Gaul the death and resurrection of Christ were regularly
          celebrated on the twenty-fifth and twenty-seventh of March as late
          as the sixth century. See Gregory of Tours, <span class=

          According to this last testimony, it was the resurrection, not the
          crucifixion, of Christ that was celebrated on the twenty-fifth of
          March; but Mgr. Duchesne attributes the statement to a mistake of
          the writer. With regard to the Roman practice the twenty-fifth and
          twenty-seventh of March are marked in ancient Martyrologies as the
          dates of the Crucifixion and Resurrection. See <span class=

          Duchesne observes: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hippolytus, in his
          Paschal Table, marks the Passion of Christ in a year in which the
          fourteenth of Nisan falls on Friday twenty-fifth March. In his
          commentary on Daniel he expressly indicates Friday the twenty-fifth
          of March and the consulship of the two Gemini. The Philocalien
          Catalogue of the Popes gives the same date as to day and year. It
          is to be noted that the cycle of Hippolytus and the Philocalien
          Catalogue are derived from official documents, and may be cited as
          evidence of the Roman ecclesiastical usage”</span> (<span class=

          sect of the Montanists held that the world began and that the sun
          and moon were created at the spring equinox, which, however, they

          "tei tei-q">“La Polémique de l'Ambrosiaster contre les
          Païens,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Though the name of Attis is not mentioned in the passage, I agree
          with Prof. Cumont in holding that the bloody expiatory rites at the
          spring equinox, to which the writer refers, can only be those of
          the Day of Blood which formed part of the great aequinoctial
          festival of Attis. Compare F. Cumont, <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The historical reality both of Buddha
          and of Christ has sometimes been doubted or denied. It would be
          just as reasonable to question the historical existence of
          Alexander the Great and Charlemagne on account of the legends which
          have gathered round them. The great religious movements which have
          stirred humanity to its depths and altered the beliefs of nations
          spring ultimately from the conscious and deliberate efforts of
          extraordinary minds, not from the blind unconscious co-operation of
          the multitude. The attempt to explain history without the influence
          of great men may flatter the vanity of the vulgar, but it will find
          no favour with the philosophic historian.</dd>

          followed soon after the Isthmian festival, which that year fell in
          spring. Others, however, identifying Hecatombeus with the Attic
          month Hecatombaeon, would place the Hyacinthia in July (K. O.
          Müller, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Breslau, 1844, i. 358). In Rhodes, Cos, and other Greek states
          there was a month called Hyacinthius, which probably took its name
          from the Hyacinthian festival. The month is thought to correspond
          to the Athenian Scirophorion and therefore to June. See E. Bischof,

          vol. i. pp. 396, 607, Nos. 614, note 3, 744, note 1. If this latter
          identification of the month is correct, it would furnish an
          argument for dating the Spartan festival of Hyacinth in June also.
          The question is too intricate to be discussed here.</dd>

          here used for sacrifice (ἐναγίζειν) properly denotes sacrifices
          offered to the heroic or worshipful dead; another word (θύειν) was
          employed for sacrifices offered to gods. The two terms are
          distinguished by Pausanias here and elsewhere (ii. 10. 1, ii. 11.
          7). Compare Herodotus, ii. 44. Sacrifices to the worshipful dead
          were often annual. See Pausanias, iii. 1. 8, vii. 19. 10, vii. 20.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
